Where the line between model and post now sits: the MODEL owns lighting,
background and rendering style (see the STYLES table in species-prompts.ts),
because Z-Image is good enough to render the era itself and does it better
than any filter. This step owns only the two things a generator cannot be
trusted with — the exact palette, and the resolution. Both are hard
requirements: 256 portraits ship in a static site and must land on the game's
three greens to the byte.

PNG. At four tones this was not even close — a dithered four-tone image is
the pathological case for JPEG, because the dither is high-frequency noise,
exactly what DCT spends its bits on, where PNG stores four colours at 2 bits
a pixel and runs the black background to almost nothing. Measured at 256px:
PNG 8.5 KB against JPEG q92's 21.9 KB, and JPEG turned 4 colours into 6397
with every pixel off-palette.

At sixteen tones that argument weakens and the numbers deserve re-running,
because sixteen levels barely need dithering at all — and undithered PNG is
much cheaper than the 23 KB measured with Floyd-Steinberg. Compare
--dither none against floyd before reaching for JPEG; the palette guarantee
is worth real bytes, and losing it is what JPEG actually costs.

Between those, one repair remains: --invert. A studio portrait is a dark
subject on a bright wall, which crushes to a glowing rectangle with a hole in
it, because a CRT means the opposite by "bright". Auto-detected per image
rather than flagged, since the model is not consistent about it.

The boundary was learned the hard way. An early prompt asked for "stark high
contrast, simple bold shapes, minimal detail" so the output would survive the
crush, and got a flat white silhouette — 2 distinct grey levels against 210
for a normally-lit portrait, nothing for four tones to dither into. Telling a
generator to REMOVE information destroys what the crush needs; telling it to
RESTRUCTURE information (dramatic key light, engraved linework) puts that
information into edges and tonal masses, which is exactly what survives.

Iteration here is free — pillow and nothing else, so re-crushing 256 portraits
takes a second where regenerating them takes hours. Tune the look here first.
