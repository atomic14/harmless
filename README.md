# Open ~~Source~~ Vibe Code

You can play HARMLESS here: https://harmless.atomic14.com/

This is a bit of an experiment. I have not looked at the code. I have no intention of looking at it. All the work has been done by Claude and other coding agents. In fact, this is the first piece of editing I've done!

The repo is Open Vibe Code (yes, I've invented a new thing!). If you want to contribute, don't open a PR - I won't be accepting any code that way.

Instead create an [issue](https://github.com/atomic14/harmless/issues/new) and describe what you want. Periodically, I'll run Claude (or other coding agent of the day) and have it run through the issues and address them.

I'm not completely sure how this will work yet - it might ask questions and clarifications - or it might just go and implement something. We'll find out!

I owe a great deal of thanks to this website - [Elite on the 6502](https://elite.bbcelite.com) - and quite likely a lot of other information that LLMs have trained on.

And now I'll hand you over to the AI.

# HARMLESS

*An unofficial browser tribute to **Elite** (1984) by David Braben and Ian
Bell. Harmless is the combat rating you start at; the ladder ends at
E L I T E.*

Authentic wireframe ships, the
original byte-accurate procedural galaxy (Lave is system 7, as it should
be), modern shader-driven suns and planets — and two hand-written ship-AI
pilots: a pursuit dogfighter flown by the pirates that chase onto your six
and by the combat computer you can buy (on your side of the fight), and a
three-phase attack run for the traders that fight back. Nothing neural
ships; the neuroevolution trainer still
lives in `train/`, but its trained policies were retired (see the
[training log](docs/TRAINING-LOG.md)).

Two playtest harnesses back this up. `npm run campaign` plays hundreds of
full commander careers headlessly — real galaxy, market, living-galaxy and
contract code, with only flight abstracted — and reports whether the economy
actually works (wealth curve, bankruptcy rate, time to first upgrade,
equipment progression, piracy losses), failing the build if it doesn't. It
can also play a commander all the way to **E L I T E** (25,600 kills) in
about 20 seconds, under three different strategies — `trader`, `hunter`,
`privateer` — which is how the combat ladder below was measured.

The docked **combat trainer** (`T` at any station) replaced three console
harnesses. It logs a fight you actually flew — your accuracy and theirs,
damage by source, the geometry that decides whether an NPC can shoot at all,
and how you fly — and exports it as JSON. Scenarios are repeatable from a
seed, so the same fight can be flown against two different brains and
compared.

It exists because every bot-flown measurement in this project turned out to be
shaped by the bot: flying straight flatters one kind of AI, flying the defence
policy flatters another. `npm run survivability` is still the bot answer to
"can I survive a gang?" — a floor measured in the training world, stand-in
pilots on both sides, so the live game sits above its rows; the trainer's
**waves** mode is the human one.

There's also an **autonomous playtest agent** (`test/playtest.js`): paste it
into the browser console with the game open and `await __playtest.run({
legs: 8 })` sends a commander off to take contracts, trade, fight, jump and
dock on its own, asserting invariants as it goes and printing a report of
everything it exercised. It's how gameplay changes get regression-tested.

CI lints, tests, builds and runs the balance playtest on every push. The
live site deploys from Cloudflare Pages (build `npm run build`, output
`dist`) — and since npm runs `prebuild` before `build`, a commit that fails
lint or tests fails the deploy build rather than shipping.

> `src/ai-training/brains/` ships empty (only a `.gitkeep`, no weight files),
> and the game imports none — it flies hand-written code pilots. Retraining
> writes candidate weights there for research; nothing loads them.

You start docked at Lave Station with 100.0 Cr, a full tank and 3 missiles.

**Saving** is a deliberate act and an automatic safety net, and the two can
never overwrite each other. **S** at a station opens the commander file: name a
save and it is yours to keep — the same name again replaces it, and it asks
first. Alongside it the game keeps its own: a **station autosave** written every
time you dock and every time you launch, and the last three **flight
autosaves**, taken every 20 seconds. Close the tab mid-fight and you resume
where you left off; die, and the station autosave puts you back where you
launched from. Loading over the run you are in says so before it happens, names
what it is about to cost, and can be backed out of.

## New to Elite?

There is a **[Space Trader's Flight Training Manual](https://harmless.atomic14.com/manual)** — how to
trade, jump, dock and survive, with a first run worked out against the game's
own market model — and **[The Long Way Out](https://harmless.atomic14.com/novella)**, an original
novella with papers from the eight galaxies.

In-game, the new pilot's briefing opens by itself the first time a commander
docks; **H** at the station reopens it whenever you want it back, and **?**
shows the controls at any time.

## Controls

Two flight layouts ship. **CLASSIC — the authentic 1984 keys — is the
default**; press **B** when docked to switch to MODERN (WASD), which is
remembered per browser. Press **?** any time for the in-game guide, which
always shows the active layout.

### Flight

| CLASSIC (default) | MODERN | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S / X | W / S | dive / climb — pitch (in both: ↓ arrow pulls up) |
| `,` / `.` | A / D | roll (arrows work in both) |
| SPACE | SPACE | accelerate |
| `/` | X or `/` | decelerate |
| A (or F) | F | fire laser (watch the temperature) |

The original's `<` `>` roll and `/` slow-down are live in both layouts, so
muscle memory from 1984 mostly survives either choice. Arrow keys always fly.

**Mouse flight**: press **V** in flight to pointer-lock the mouse into a
self-centring analogue stick (left button fires). Touching the keyboard
overrides it; ESC or V releases. This is the closest thing to the
joystick the original supported.

### Commands (identical in both layouts)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 | front / rear / left / right view |
| T / M / U | arm missile (locks in your sights) / fire / unarm |
| E / TAB | E.C.M. / energy bomb (if fitted) |
| J | torus jump drive (8×, stars streak; cuts out when mass-locked) |
| C | docking computer — flies you in; press again or touch the controls to take over |
| K | combat computer — a scripted co-pilot flies your ship onto your attacker's six (if fitted) |
| N / G | short range chart / galactic chart |
| H / ⇧H | hyperspace jump / galactic hyperdrive (if fitted) |
| B | distress beacon — GalCop tows you out of witch-space, for your cargo |
| Y / ⇧Y | jettison a tonne of cargo / five at once — pirates came for the goods, not for you |
| I | commander status |
| P | pause |
| Q | quit this flight — asks first, then puts you back at the station autosave you launched from |
| V | mouse flight — pointer-locked analogue stick, left button fires |
| ? | controls guide |

Views on 1-4 (the original used F0-F3) and screens on letters (were F4-F9),
because browsers claim the function keys.

### Docked

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| L | launch |
| M / C / E | market · contracts · equip ship |
| N / G / D / I | local chart · galactic chart · data on system · status |
| **T** | **combat training simulator** — practise a fight; nothing in it reaches your commander |
| ⇧T | test mode — development levers; a career that switches them on says so on its status screen, for good |
| H | new pilot's briefing |
| P | pay your fine — clear an Offender or Fugitive record |
| B | switch keyboard layout |
| S | commander file — named saves and autosaves (S saves the run · ENTER loads, asking first · D deletes · R changes what you are called) |
| X / Z | export · import a save file |
| Q | start a new commander (confirms first) |

↑↓ and ENTER work on the menu as well as the letter keys.

### Combat training simulator

Free, at every station, on **T**. Pick a mode (one scored fight · endless
sparring against one hull · escalating waves), a scenario, a threat tier, an
optional seed, and optionally build the opposition yourself — hull, count,
tier, how they fly and fit, per group — plus a fit-out override for your own
ship. ENTER launches; **L** re-opens the last report; **ESC** or **Q** ends the
exercise. The panel is grouped — the fight, who flies what, your ship — with
**LIVE BRAINS (COMMANDER)** fenced off at the foot, because that one is still set
when you undock. A brain is picked by how it flies — `FIGHTS BACK`,
`MAKES ATTACK RUNS`, `GETS ON YOUR SIX` — with the pilot behind the name for
anyone reading the training log.

**Waves** escalates twice. First the numbers — one ship becomes six, an
opportunist becomes an organised gang — and at wave 11 they stop, deliberately,
because a ramp that keeps adding ships makes the score a fact about arithmetic
rather than about flying. Then the *fight* keeps changing: they carry missiles
at 12, E.C.M. at 14, one of them is a bounty hunter at 16, and at 18 two of the
pirates stand down for a Thargoid and its Thargon — the toughest hull in the
game, whose drone goes inert the moment it dies. From 18 on every wave is the
same, so surviving three of them is a fact about flying. The cockpit strip
carries what is out there, the banner names each new thing as it arrives, and
the report quotes both with the reason. The furthest wave you ever reach is
kept with the commander and shown on the panel; it is the one number a run
leaves behind, and nothing in the career reads it.

A row over a list says where in it you are (`5/12`) and **HOME/END** go to
either end without walking there. Selecting a brain row prints what that brain
does in a fight, with the measured number that shows it — the attack-run pilot
lands 58% of its shots at ~5 runs a minute and sits 31.8s on a hauler's six —
so choosing one is a choice about behaviour rather than a filename. The shipped
`pursuit` pirate post-dates the evaluation tournament, so it is unprobed there.
The figures that exist come from `train/flight-probe.ts` or the evaluation
tournament, both archived under `train/logs/`.

It is the real game: real flight model, real brains, real guns. But
**nothing that happens in it leaves it** — no kills, no combat rating, no
credits, no legal status, no save write, and death ends the exercise rather
than the career. The single exception is stated as one: the furthest wave a
waves run reached, which is saved with the commander and read by nothing else. Afterwards you get a report (accuracy both ways, damage by
source, engagement ranges, time on each other's six, your own flight
envelope) which exports as JSON to the clipboard or a file, and lands on
`window.__simLog` for a console session or an agent to read.

**←→** walks the recent records and **ENTER** holds two of them side by side —
this, that, and the difference — because the method is an A/B: same seed, same
scenario, two brains. It only subtracts them when they really are one fight
flown twice. Two records on different seeds, scenarios, modes, waves, hulls or
fit-outs are not an A/B, so it names exactly which fields differ and shows no
difference column at all; different **brains** is the point, different anything
else is a confound. **C** and **X** then take the pair, since the pair is the
finding.

### Market

↑↓ select · B buy · V sell · ESC exit

### Charts

**Click a system to target it** · arrows move the cursor · ENTER set
hyperspace target · **D data on system** (the full statistics page with the
original's procedurally generated planet description) · M market estimate ·
F find a system by name · ESC exit

A **red ring** marks a system merchants are reporting heavy pirate activity
in — the living galaxy's own losses, on the same threshold that world's data
screen reports in words, so the map and the news can never disagree.

**T** cycles the trade overlay: **routes in flight** draws the lanes with more
than one convoy on them (~45 of the ~175 pairs trading at any moment), and
**prices** arrows the worlds trading well off the 1984 baseline — up amber for
dear, down green for cheap. Both charts share the mode, and the rings stay
under all of it.

Lanes fade with how much freight is on them. Point at one — mouse or cursor —
and the chart names both worlds, the convoys on it, their tonnage, their cargo
and when the next load lands.

### Docking and the console

Fly into the station's docking port with your wings matched to its rotation.
An amber marker shows where the port is, with an arrow at the screen edge
when it's behind you; it turns green and reads DOCKING PORT — LINED UP when
you're on the axis and rolled to match. Get it wrong and you'll bounce off
with shield damage — or buy the docking computer.

In a fight, a red arrow at the screen edge points at the nearest hostile you
can't currently see.

The console lights an **S** while the station is in scanner range (its
defences cover you there) and an **E** when an E.C.M. broadcast is
detected — as on the original's dashboard.

## Game systems

- **Trading** — 17 commodities with the original price/quantity model;
  economies matter (buy food cheap at agriculturals, sell computers dear).
  20t hold; precious metals/gems don't take hold space.
- **Combat** — pulse/beam/military lasers with heat, four mounts, homing
  missiles you arm and then lock by putting the target in your sights,
  on-screen target brackets with a lead marker, hull hits that cost you
  cargo and fittings, bounties, kill ratings from Harmless to E L I T E.
  Damage is the released game's own arithmetic: what a laser is worth is
  decoded from its byte, what it costs a target is that target's own defence,
  and your fore shield, aft shield and energy bank are three 255-point pools —
  see [docs/ELITE-A.md](docs/ELITE-A.md) and
  [docs/DAMAGE-PATHS.md](docs/DAMAGE-PATHS.md). Pirate numbers scale with the
  government type; shoot police or traders and you become a fugitive (police
  attack; fine on docking).
- **Hyperspace** — 7.0 LY fuel range, per-jump fuel cost by real chart
  distance, 5-second countdown.
- **Death** — ship destroyed → ENTER takes you back to the station autosave
  you launched from, with what you left with (unless an escape pod saves you,
  at the cost of your cargo), or S opens the commander file to pick a save of
  your own. The in-flight autosaves are dropped: dying costs you the run.
- **Legal system** — CLEAN → OFFENDER → FUGITIVE; police scan for contraband
  (slaves, narcotics, firearms), bounty hunters stalk offenders, fines on
  docking.
- **A living system** — traders warp in, do business at the station and jump
  out; pirates hunt them for cargo you can scoop; police hunt the pirates.
- **Witch-space** — mis-jumps drop you among Thargoids and their Thargon
  drones. High bounties, if you live. Out of fuel out there? Broadcast a
  distress beacon and GalCop will tow you clear — they'll take your cargo
  as the salvage fee.
- **Mining & scooping** — blast asteroids (mining laser drops ore canisters)
  and scoop drifting cargo with fuel scoops; sun-skim to refuel, watching the
  cabin temperature.
- **A living galaxy** — trade runs between all 256 systems while you play.
  Convoys depart from productive worlds, get taken by pirates in lawless
  space, and arrive in your system as real ships. Prices drift with supply,
  pirate hotspots emerge along dangerous routes, and the system data screen
  reports the news. The 1984 economy stays the baseline underneath — this
  layer only ever nudges it ±25%.
- **Pirates as businesses** — what waits for you on the way in depends on
  what you're visibly worth. An empty Cobra draws a couple of opportunists in
  Sidewinders; a full hold draws professionals; a fat, notorious one draws an
  organised gang. A gang isn't five
  Fer-de-Lances, though — it's two ringleaders plus hangers-on in whatever
  they could afford, which is why they can be common without being hopeless. Only
  what a pirate can *see* counts — cargo, hold size, fitted laser, your
  reputation — never your bank balance, so banking the money and flying clean
  is a real strategy. Threat grows far slower than your ship does, so upgrades
  are felt rather than cancelled out. And since they came for the cargo,
  **jettisoning it (Y) buys them off** — proportionally: opportunists want a
  little, a gang that organised for you wants about a third of the prize.
  Selling big or dirty loads raises your profile here and in neighbouring
  systems, and it fades if you lie low. Your **reputation cuts both ways**:
  it scares off thieves after easy cargo, but once you're Dangerous roughly a
  third of the ships waiting for you came for the name rather than the hold.
  Ratings count difficulty too — a gang's Fer-de-Lance is worth five
  Sidewinders — so the ladder rewards the fights worth having.
- **Contracts** — every station runs a bulletin board with cargo runs,
  courier jobs and pirate-clearing bounties, available from your very first
  landing. Deadlines are measured in days, which pass as you jump. (The
  original made you earn your first mission with 16 kills; a new commander
  deserves somewhere to be.)
- **Navy missions** — prove yourself (16+ kills, galaxy 1) for the
  Constrictor hunt and the classified courier run.
- **Don't shoot the station.** Its hull shrugs off a laser, but GalCop
  notices: you're marked an offender and the station scrambles Vipers from
  the slot. Shooting *those* is how you become a fugitive.
- **Encounters** — destroyed ships eject escape capsules (scoop one and the
  survivor becomes, regrettably, cargo); stations scramble Vipers if you
  misbehave in their sight; rock hermits hide among the asteroids, dealing
  ore and asking no questions; derelict generation ships drift between the
  stars; and someone will sell you a Trumble for 2 credits, which is one of
  the worst decisions available to you.
- **Two hand-written ship AIs** — pirates fly `pursuit`, the dogfighter that
  chases onto your six and holds there, breaking into a slashing attack run the
  moment you turn your nose onto it; armed traders turn and fight with
  `attack-run`, the three-phase run (close, fire through the pass, swing out
  and come round again); and the combat computer you can buy flies the pursuit
  dogfighter on your own ship, onto your attacker's six. All of it is code, not
  neural nets: the policies
  self-play kept finding were turrets that hung in space and sniped, so the
  trained line was retired in 2026-08 (docs/TRAINING-LOG.md keeps every figure).
  Watch either fight in the combat viewer.

## Architecture

- `src/galaxy/` — the genuine Elite galaxy algorithm: three twisted 16-bit
  seed words generate all 256 systems per galaxy (names, economy, government,
  tech level, market). Galaxy 1 is byte-identical to the original — system 7
  is Lave.
- `src/ships/` — all 38 released hulls as explicit vertex/edge/face tables in
  the style of the original BBC data, generated from the vendored reference
  pack and exact to the source rather than drawn by eye. Thirty-one of them
  turn up in play (Cobra Mk III and Mk I, Sidewinder, Viper, Adder, Krait,
  Mamba, Fer-de-Lance, Python, Anaconda, Boa, Gecko, Moray, Worm, Shuttle and
  Shuttle Mk II, Transporter, Dragon, Monitor, Ophidian, Ghavial, Bushmaster,
  Rattler, Iguana, Chameleon, Thargoid, Thargon, Constrictor, missile,
  canister, escape capsule); the Coriolis and Dodo stations are the same
  tables at a larger presentation scale. All drawn as wireframe edges over a
  black occluding hull (classic hidden-line look), and all 38 browsable at
  `/gallery`.
- `src/world/` — shader sun (animated fbm surface, limb darkening, corona),
  shader planet (coastline contours, graticule, terminator, atmosphere rim —
  seeded per system), starfield, space dust, per-system scene assembly.
- `src/game/` — game orchestrator (modes, docking, hyperspace, combat),
  NPC AI (traders/pirates/police), commander state + saves.
- `src/hud/`, `src/ui/` — scanner/compass/gauges console and the full-page
  screens (station menu, market, chart, status).
- `src/audio.ts` — WebAudio synth in the spirit of the BBC sound chip,
  including the docking waltz. The Commodore 64 Elite played *An der schönen
  blauen Donau* while you docked; the tune is Strauss, 1866, and comfortably
  public domain, so it is synthesised here from note data rather than shipping
  audio from the original game — this repo contains no assets from Elite.
- `src/ai-training/` + `train/` — render-free combat simulator, tiny MLP policies
  (1.9k params, keyboard-style discrete actions) and a neuroevolution
  self-play trainer. `src/ai-training/brains/` ships empty (only a `.gitkeep`):
  the game flies three hand-written code pilots — `pursuit` (the dogfighter
  every pirate uses, and the purchasable combat computer's own flight, turned
  to your defence), `attack-run` (the defence name: the three-phase run an
  armed trader turns and fights with, and the name the co-pilot is selected
  under) and `scripted` (an A/B control that reverts the pirates to the attack
  run and switches the defence off). The trained line — two pirate policies and
  the `jameson-defend` defence policy — was deleted 2026-08-05 after three
  retrains optimised their way out of fighting; `docs/TRAINING-LOG.md` keeps
  every figure, and `train/evolve.ts` can still breed a candidate for research.
  A test asserts the weights directory matches what `brains.ts` imports, which
  today is nothing. The combat viewer (`/viewer`) replays matchups with the real
  wireframe ships, and every row in it flies one of those code pilots or a
  stated control. See `docs/AI-TRAINING.md` and `docs/TRAINING-LOG.md`.
- Rendering: three.js + UnrealBloom for the phosphor glow.

## Acknowledgements & legal

This is a non-commercial fan homage, released under the MIT license (see
LICENSE). Elite (1984) was created by Ian Bell and David Braben and published
by Acornsoft; the "Elite" trademark belongs to Frontier Developments plc.
This project is affiliated with none of them. The galaxy generator and the
ship tables both follow long-published descriptions of the original data —
the hulls were hand-made approximations until 2026-08, and are now generated
from a vendored analysis pack of the released ship files
([docs/ELITE-A.md](docs/ELITE-A.md)). This repo contains no assets from Elite.

## Roadmap

[docs/GAP-ANALYSIS.md](docs/GAP-ANALYSIS.md) tracks feature-by-feature parity
with the original manual, and almost all of it is implemented — including the
things this section used to list as outstanding: side laser mounts, mouse
flight, the two-level living galaxy, and the purchasable combat computer.

Remaining: gamepad support, and a player shipyard (all 15 flyable hulls are
imported and resolve; nothing can yet change which one you fly — see the
deferred list in [docs/ELITE-A.md](docs/ELITE-A.md)). Pirates already fly the
`pursuit` dogfighter by default, solo and in a gang alike; the trained pack
brain that once flew the gangs was retired with the rest of the neural line.

Combat balance is **not settled**, and this file quotes no figure for it on
purpose: the damage model moved to the released game's own arithmetic in
2026-08, so every number measured before that describes a different game.
Measure it, don't cite it — `npm run campaign`, `npm run survivability`, and
the docked combat trainer's JSON export.

One finding worth reading before touching combat AI, from
[docs/TRAINING-LOG.md](docs/TRAINING-LOG.md): in a recorded human fight,
pirates lined up on the player only a small fraction of the time and landed
most of the shots they did take, so the balance rests on pursuit being
imperfect — "better" pursuit is not automatically better. That is a shape, and
it survives the change of units; the percentages in the log entry do not.
