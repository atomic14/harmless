// ONE HOME FOR EVERY CONSTANT — the gate that makes docs/TODO/90 stick.
//
// The move is a one-off tidy without this. `MAX_TRADERS` grew a second home in
// `encounters.ts` and `population.ts` and nothing noticed for months, and the
// only reason anybody knows is that a human read both files. A scan is the only
// thing that can notice.
//
// WHAT IT ENFORCES
//
//   1. Every module-level `UPPER_CASE` const declared in `src/` outside
//      `src/constants/` is named on THE LIST below. The list is the project
//      plan: one group per slice, shrinking as each subject moves. When a group
//      empties, its heading goes with it.
//   2. Nothing on the list is stale. A file that has lost its constants — or a
//      name that has — has to come off, or the list becomes a place to hide.
//   3. `src/constants/` imports nothing outside `src/constants/`. It is a leaf
//      and four modules plus the portability gate depend on that.
//   4. No name is declared twice inside `src/constants/`, and no name declared
//      there is declared anywhere else in `src/`. That is "one home", checked
//      rather than intended, and it is the check `MAX_TRADERS` would have
//      failed.
//
// HOW IT LOOKS, AND WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS GREP
//
// docs/TODO/90 shipped with a census grep that only matched a right-hand side
// beginning with an UPPER_CASE identifier. It therefore missed every derived
// constant wrapped in a call, a paren or a digit — `Math.round(MAX_ENERGY / 4)`,
// `(EXTEND_RANGE_MIN + EXTEND_RANGE_MAX) / 2`,
// `playerHull(...).energyRechargeRating` — and the
// item concluded from it that the codebase had exactly ONE derived constant when
// it has at least twenty. So this scan looks at the LEFT of the `=` and never at
// the right: a declaration is a declaration whatever it is initialised from.
//
// Two deliberate narrowings, both of them the item's own exclusions:
//
//   * COLUMN ZERO ONLY. An indented `const` is inside a function, and "values
//     whose only meaning is local to one function" are out of scope.
//   * COMMENTS STRIPPED. This project's prose names the things it deleted, on
//     purpose, and a scan that read the comments would fire on that history.
//
// `src/` only. `train/` and `tools/` are outside the home by decision, not by
// omission: the survey's answer is that `train/` should CONSUME src/constants/
// and keep its own search hyperparameters, seed bases and probe thresholds in a
// `train/constants.ts` that nothing in `src/` may import, and that `tools/` is a
// separate world. Neither is a game rule's home, so neither is gated here.
//
// Modelled on `test/ai.test.ts`'s purity list and `tools/sizes.mjs`: a policy
// enforced by scanning source, with an allowlist that is itself the review
// surface. Both of those have held.
