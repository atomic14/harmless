// grew from one steering rule into a whole cycle. It was the middle third of
// `npc.test.ts`, which reached 440 lines — and "it is long" is not a reason to
// allowlist, so it split where the subsystem already had a seam.
//
// What it holds: that a hostile shoots at every range a fight happens at (the
// TODO 42 regression), that the ship flies THROUGH the pass rather than
// attempting a 180 it has no room for, that the cycle comes back round, and
// that being shot at while extending breaks the straight line.
//
// WHERE the closing leg aims is `pass-aim.test.ts`, beside `game/pass-aim.ts`,
// for the same reason this file exists: it is its own module now.
