// Ship identity: one id, one record, and what a save without one becomes.
//
// TODO 23's gate. The identities themselves are in src/game/ship-identity.ts;
// what this file asserts is the part that can go quietly wrong later —
//
//   * an id resolves to exactly ONE immutable record, and a value that is not
//     an id is refused rather than half-resolved;
//   * the two Harmless inventions stay visibly ours and never look like
//     recovered source designs;
//   * a save that does not say what it is flying is REFUSED — as a record that
//     reads as nothing, and as a world that will not restore;
//   * all 15 flyable hulls survive commander JSON and the simulator's clone;
//   * every ship in today's roster survives a snapshot, INCLUDING an exact
//     variant that is not its design's recommended one — because re-deriving
//     identity on restore looks identical until the day something picks a
//     different build;
//   * and restoring costs nothing from the rng and changes nobody's identity.
//
// It is deliberately not a second copy of the catalogue's own gate: counts and
// provenance are test/elite-a-catalogue.test.ts's job.
