// One resolver: the same shot, resolved by the game and by the trainer.
//
// docs/TODO/64. Invariant 15 splits deciding from resolving and there are two
// Games — `world-step.ts` for the sky, `ai-training/scenario.ts` for a training
// episode — so the DECISION half had one home each and the RESOLUTION half had
// two, which drifted four times without anything reporting it: the weapon the
// ship chose, the rack it spent, the missile decision itself, and the target's
// recharge. `game/fire-resolution.ts` is the one home now, and this is what
// stops a fifth.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE GATE IS THE POINT, and the item is explicit about it: not
// "the resolver works", but the SAME `FireEvent` and the SAME seed through BOTH
// callers, asserting identical damage, identical rack and identical pools. A
// test that drove the shared function twice would agree with itself and would
// have passed on the code as it was.
//
// So the two paths really are the two paths. The game side goes through
// `WorldStep`'s own private `resolveNpcFire` into a `StepHost` that spends the
// hit through `damagePlayer` — the same call `game.ts` makes — and the trainer
// side through `Episode`'s own private `resolveNpcShot` into
// `TargetShip.takeDamage`. Neither is re-implemented here.
//
// The SHOOTER is shared by construction: two episodes built from one seed hold
// the same ships, drawn in the same order out of the same stream, so "the same
// weapon byte, the same hull, the same rack" is a property of the fixture rather
// than something arranged by hand.
//
// Vacuity: deleting a branch of the resolver must fail this file. The probes and
// what each one broke are recorded in docs/TODO/64.
