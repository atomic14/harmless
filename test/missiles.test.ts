// Missiles, in the game and in the trainer — and that they are the same missile.
//
// docs/TODO/62. A pirate has always carried a rack and `NpcShip.chooseWeapon`
// has always known when to spend it, but the call was reachable only from
// `NpcShip.update()`, which a training episode never makes: measured, 200 armed
// and hurt pirates driven the way an episode drives them asked to fire 1,374
// times and asked for a missile **zero** times. On top of that the trainer's
// resolver never read `shot.weapon` (so a missile would have landed instantly,
// for laser damage) and never spent the round (so the rack was infinite).
//
// Three defects, one cause: invariant 15 splits deciding from resolving, and
// there are two resolvers — `world-step.ts` and `ai-training/scenario.ts`. This
// file holds the part of that seam that IS shared now, and says what is not.
// The general version is docs/TODO/64.

// This flies the real `Game` on `headlessShell()`, as test/game.test.ts does. The
// gang is placed by hand rather than rolled, because the fixture is about the
// missile path and not about who turned up: a Python has two on the rail, and
// hurting them below `MISSILE_LAST_STAND_HULL` makes `npcMissileEmergency`'s
// first reason true from the first frame.
//
// It is also the shape that proved this change byte-identical against 38914c7 —
// a 5 MB per-frame trace, same sha256 on both checkouts. That comparison needs
// two working trees and cannot live here; what lives here is the half that can,
