// The scripted combat computer: a pursuit dogfighter flying YOUR ship.
//
// Added 2026-08-05, after the third trained-defence wall in a row (runs
// 20-21: turret, sprayer, pacifist — docs/TRAINING-LOG.md). It first flew the
// pirates' attack run and Chris found it let go of a target close up (the pass
// phase steers nowhere), so it diverged to pure pursuit — get on the six and
// hold guns on target. What these blocks pin is the co-pilot's own contract: it
// decides and reports (the Game flies the demand and shoots), its trigger is
// the player gun's real cone, its E.C.M. answers only a warhead that exists, and
// it PURSUES a crossing target rather than losing it.
