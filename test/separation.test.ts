// Keeping wingmen out of each other's way: the curve, the direction, the two
// guards — and that the attack run still applies them.
//
// `game/separation.ts` was written, swept against a measured table in its own
// header, and wired into all three legs of the attack run, and NOTHING imported
// it. Gutting `separationFrom` so that it always answered "nobody near" — which
// deletes wingman avoidance from `closing`, `passing` and `extending` at once —
// left `npm test` green at 2982 passed, 0 failed (docs/TODO/76). That is what
// this file is for, and it needs both of its halves to be it.
//
// THE PURE HALF is most of it. The module takes positions rather than ships
// precisely so a test can put two hulls exactly where it wants them, so the
// whole rule is assertable without flying anything: 0 at the edge of the range,
// 1 at contact, a straight line between, the NEAREST mate rather than an
// average of several, and the two guards.
//
// THE FLYING HALF is here because a pure test cannot see a CALL SITE, and three
// call sites are what the mutation above actually deletes. Each of them is
// subtle in a different way — `passing` steers for nothing else at all,
// `extending` shares its scratch with the arc, `closing` bends the aim point —
// so each gets its own merge and its own control.
//
// It is in this file rather than in test/npc.test.ts because what it asserts is
// this module's rule reaching the flight, not a fact about NpcShip: one rule,
// one test file, the same reason `pass-aim` and `extend-arc` have theirs. (It
// would also have taken npc.test.ts through the 400-line ceiling, which is the
// same argument arriving from the other end.)
