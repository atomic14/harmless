// WHAT A CHAMPION IS CHOSEN BY — `train/selection.ts`, run rather than read.
//
// docs/TODO/65 was found by reading arithmetic: `evolve.ts` scored a defence
// champion by `hp * 1000 + clamp(shaped, ±499)`, real shaped values come out
// between 8 and 19, so shooting was worth 1.9% of a number that survival owned
// outright. Nothing could ask the rule a question, because the rule was two
// expressions inside a script that parses argv and starts training on import.
//
// It is a module now, and this file asks it the question the item asks:
//
//   does a defence policy that engages and kills outrank one that survives
//   without firing?
//
// It is asked of TWO HAND-BUILT GENOMES — no training, no weights file, no
// search. They are the same genome apart from ONE NUMBER, the bias on the fire
// head, so everything else about the comparison is held constant by
// construction: same flying, same geometry, same seeds, same dice. One pulls
// the trigger and one does not.
//
// The pair is also the cleanest measurement of the second defect docs/TODO/63
// left behind. The turret kills 69% of its attackers, clears more than half its
// fights, takes ~20% LESS cumulative damage than the pacifist — and ends with
// LOWER terminal `hp`, because clearing a fight ends the episode early and she
// heals for less of the clock. The rule this replaced read terminal `hp` and
// therefore ranked the pacifist first, which is asserted below so that putting
// it back fails here.

/**
 * 96, and the number is load-bearing rather than generous.
 *
 * It was 24, and 24 was UNDER-POWERED ALL ALONG — which is the useful half of
 * this comment, because it was not obvious until something moved. The quantity
 * the last assertion in this section turns on is the terminal-hp gap between
 * the two genomes, and 24 episodes cannot resolve it. Flown on the same code at
 * three sizes, the gap is 0.7 percentage points of hull at 24, 2.4 at 48 and
 * 3.8 at 96, and the old rule's margin follows it.
 *
 * What exposed that was docs/TODO/68's vocabulary of tactics, which squeezed
 * the gap: measured like for like at 96 episodes, against HEAD before it, a
 * gang takes 257 -> 234 points off the turret and 276 -> 257 off the pacifist,
 * so the old rule's margin goes 40.0 -> 31.7. A real cost, comfortably
 * asserted. On the 24-episode fixture the same pair of runs read 73 -> 0.5,
 * which looked like a collapse and was mostly sampling — the honest lesson is
 * that a two-genome comparison on a stochastic fight needs the episodes, not
 * that the vocabulary nearly broke the claim.
 *
 * The whole file costs about a second either way, so there is nothing to buy
 * back by shrinking it. If a future change squeezes the gap again, widen this
 * rather than loosening the assertion — and if it inverts, that is a real
 * finding about the flight model and should be reported as one.
