// The setup panel's SHAPE: three groups, one fence, and a height that holds.
//
// The fifth combat-trainer file, and the one about the panel as a thing to look
// at rather than a draft to build. It exists because the panel was thirteen rows
// in one flat column, every one the same weight — including the one row that is
// still set when you undock — so finding a setting meant reading rather than
// scanning, and a warning appearing mid-interaction moved the row out from under
// the cursor. What is here is the layout, the reserved heights, the way a long
// list is navigated and the keys the panel offers; what a row READS AS is a
// different question and is asserted in combat-sim-rows.test.ts.
//
// Everything here is pure: `setupCells()` and the notes are functions of a
// draft, so the shape can be asserted under node with no browser. The two rules
// worth keeping are that a group HEADING is never a row (the cursor and every
// `data-row` index the same list) and that the reserve is an upper bound on the
// notes for every draft, not just the one in front of you.
