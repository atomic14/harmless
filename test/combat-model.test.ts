// --- one combat model, and the trainer flies it -----------------------------
//
// WHAT WAS HERE: about twenty checks comparing `src/ai-training/core.ts` to
// `src/game/{npc,gunnery,collisions}.ts` and `src/player.ts`, field by field —
// laser damage, cooldown, heat and range, the NPC gun's gate, cadence and hit
// curve, ram damage, the speed floor, per-hull hp/speed/turn/radius, two rate
// ramps and two decays. They existed because the combat model was written
// twice, and they were worth having: the block caught an NPC gun firing 5.4x
// too fast, an `accel: 120` against the player's real 220, and a turn decay
// that had drifted 35% at the two files' respective step rates.
//
// The duplication is gone. `ai-training/core.ts` is deleted and a training
// episode flies `NpcShip`, `PlayerShip`, `gunnery.ts`, `collisions.ts` and
// `rng.ts` — the game itself, with the sky emptied. A check that a number
// equals itself is not a test, so these checks are not replaced by other
// checks; they are replaced by there being one number.
//
// What survives is a different question, and a better one: does the trainer
// really fly the game? That is a property of the code now rather than of a
// promise in CLAUDE.md, and this is where it is asserted.
