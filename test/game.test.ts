// The orchestrator, driven for real.
//
// `game.ts` is the largest file in the project and had **zero** test coverage —
// not because the orchestrator needed a browser, but because four of its fields
// did: a render stack, an Input, a Hud and a TunnelEffect, each reaching for
// `document` in a field initializer. Eleven lines of DOM in 1,757 made the
// whole file unconstructible under node, so the step order, the mode machine
// and every `apply*` were exercised only by a human with a tab open.
//
// A `Shell` fixed that (engine/shell.ts). These tests build a real Game on the
// headless one and fly it, which is the difference between "the shell is
// separable" as a claim and as a fact: if a browser API creeps back into
// game.ts, this file stops running.
//
// It also guards the seam from the other side — `npm test` asserts that
// game.ts names no DOM type at all, because the compiler will not.
