// half of stage 6 that a browser is not needed for, which is nearly all of it:
// the bindings are a table over a two-method input, and the setup panel is a
// pure function from a draft to a list of rows.
//
// The checks at the bottom used to be "the other two homes of a key binding",
// because an audit found 13 disagreements between the four places CLAUDE.md's
// key-bindings invariant listed — `B` for the distress beacon, which costs you
// your cargo, appeared in no help panel at all. Those homes are down to one
// each now (docs/TODO/50): the menu and the panel's rows are painted from
// `BINDINGS` + `COMMAND_HELP`, and `test/key-help.test.ts` asserts the general
// claim in both directions. What is left here is the trainer's own claim on
// those surfaces.
