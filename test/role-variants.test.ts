// Which released BUILD a role flies — the selection policy's gate.
//
// `src/game/role-variants.ts` is the file this covers, and the load-bearing
// claim is a negative one: threat was restored WITHOUT touching the combat
// rules. So the assertions come in three groups.
//
//   1. Everything selected is a real released row of the vendored pack, present
//      in a slot the role's own bands cover. Nothing is averaged, invented or
//      copied — a synthesised stat block would pass a damage check and fail
//      every one of these.
//   2. The choice is deterministic and total: the same answer twice, no rng
//      touched, a defined answer for every role and every design, and the same
//      answer a legacy snapshot re-derives on restore.
//   3. THE POINT OF THE EXERCISE — no combat role flies a build that cannot
//      damage a Cobra Mk III. The Asp Mk II was exactly that failure until a
//      decode bug was fixed (combat-math.ts `eliteANpcLaserPower`); its byte is
//      laser power nine, and it now hits for 29 and flies as a pirate.
//
// The oracle itself is not re-tested here; `test/elite-a-oracle.test.ts` owns
// the arithmetic and this file must not restate a line of it. What it does is
// drive the LIVE expression — the roster's own profile, its own byte, the
// commander's own armour — because a selection policy that picks a harder
// variant nothing reads would be no change at all.
