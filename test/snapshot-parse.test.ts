// The parse boundary: a snapshot is validated whole at the door, or refused
// whole — "refused" and "half applied" must never be the same state again
// (docs/TODO/94).
//
// The gate is derived from what the game actually writes, so it cannot rot:
// `capture()` produces the canonical valid snapshot, `parse(capture(world))`
// must succeed and deep-equal its input, and deleting or corrupting ANY field
// of a real captured snapshot must fail the parse — the sweep walks the
// captured object's own keys rather than a written list, so a field added to
// `capture()` next year is covered the day it is added, and a parser that
// quietly stops checking something goes red here.
//
// The last block is the property the item exists for: a refused restore
// leaves the live session untouched, byte for byte, where it used to leave
// the commander replaced, the galaxy regenerated and the scene rebuilt with
// no fleet.
