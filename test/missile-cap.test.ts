// ONE WARHEAD IN THE AIR AT A TIME — the fairness cap, and nothing else.
//
// `test/missiles.test.ts` covers a missile LEAVING the rail: that both worlds
// resolve one launch identically, what it costs her, and that a pirate in a real
// fight actually reaches for one. This file covers the rule that says it may
// NOT: `WorldView.missileInbound`, read once per frame by the orchestrator and
// applied by `NpcShip.chooseWeapon`.
//
// It is its own file because it is its own rule, with its own recorded reason.
// E.C.M. destroys every missile in flight in one burst for a quarter of the
// bank, so it is a complete answer to one missile and no answer at all to five
// — which is how a wave-13 gang put three through in nine seconds. Capping the
// air is what makes the counterplay the player already owns work.
//
// docs/TODO/83: the rule has three cooperating parts and had no gate at all.
// Deleting the guard in `chooseWeapon` — `if (missileInbound && false) return
// shot;` — left the whole suite green; it fails 13 assertions in this file now.
// The other two parts are gated here as well, because each can drift on its
// own: moving the `missileInbound` read inside the NPC loop fails 2 here, and
// arming the reload before refusing — the guard behind `npcMissileEmergency`
// rather than in front of it — fails 6. Two of those show up outside this file:
// the loop mutation reddens `missiles.test.ts`'s "it kills her", which reports
// the lethality and not the rule, and the arming one reddens a selection
// comparison in `selection.test.ts` that turns on 0.3 points of shaped score.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-04, one mutation at a time against a clean tree. The
// counts moved when docs/TODO/77 took the reload tick out of `chooseWeapon`:
// there used to be a fourth mutation here, "the guard ahead of the reload
// tick" (4 assertions), and there is no tick left in this function to be ahead
// of. The rule it protected is now structural rather than positional — see the
// last block in this file.
