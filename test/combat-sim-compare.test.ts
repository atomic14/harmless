// Two records held against each other — and the refusal when they may not be.
//
// The comparison is DERIVED (docs/TODO/completed/35-compare-two-records.md): no new
// accumulation, no new sampling, just a pure function of two finished records.
// So it is stated here the way test/combat-sim-report.test.ts states its
// medians — records built by hand, and the answer written out independently.
//
// The half worth reading is the REFUSAL. Subtracting two numbers is always
// possible and only sometimes meaningful, and a difference column over two
// different fights is a number that looks like a finding. Each case below
// changes exactly one thing about the fight's identity and asserts that the
// comparison names it and stops differencing — including the two the task
// singles out, a different wave and a different opponent count.
