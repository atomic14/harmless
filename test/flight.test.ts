// --- flight demands: what the pilot wants, and who wanted it ----------------
//
// player.ts used to read the keyboard: `update(dt, input: Input)`. So the
// player, an autopilot and a replay were three different interfaces, the
// flight model could not be constructed outside a browser, and the combat
// computer had to reach past it and rotate the quaternion itself.
//
// Now `update(dt, demand)` flies a FlightDemand and the pilots produce one:
// `flightDemand()` from a keyboard, `CombatComputer.step()` from the defence
// brain. These tests exist because that swap must be invisible from the
// cockpit — same rates, same ramp, same mouse flight, same everything.
