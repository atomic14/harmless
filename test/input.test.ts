// The keyboard, frame by frame.
//
// `engine/input.ts` is where a key press becomes something the game can read,
// and its whole contract is about FRAMES: what is held, what was tapped, and
// what happens to a tap nobody read. That last one had a bug worth a test file
// of its own — `pressed()` takes one tap and `endFrame()` threw the rest away,
// so a second tap of the same key inside one frame never arrived. Invisible at
// 60Hz with the window focused; the whole story in a throttled tab, where a
// second of keystrokes lands in one frame and a menu appears to ignore you.
//
// What is asserted here is the CARRY and its two bounds — interest and count —
// because a fix that carried taps without a bound would swap a lost press for a
// banked burst, which is the worse bug of the two. The interest bound has its
// own test below for a specific reason: the first attempt at this carried every
// unread tap, and the pause test in game.test.ts caught a P pressed at the
// station pausing the game a step after launch. A tap must never arrive
// somewhere that was not already asking for that key.
//
// No DOM: `new Input()` deliberately constructs without one (there are no
// listeners, so presses arrive via `injectPress`, exactly as a click does).
