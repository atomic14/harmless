// --- the snapshot actually round-trips --------------------------------------

// snapshot.ts had no direct coverage at all. Everything above it is a grep
// over game.ts asking whether a field NAME appears in captureSnapshot and
// restoreSnapshot — which cannot see whether the value that came back is the
// value that went in, nor whether it landed in the object the renderer reads.
//
// That is exactly the gap the file's own history describes: four rounds of
// "two reloads agree with each other but not with the run they came from".
// A name-presence check passes through every one of them, because in each
// case the name WAS there.
//
// So: build state, fly it until nothing is at its default, serialise, restore
// into a FRESH object, and compare field by field — then step both on and
// demand they stay identical, which is the property the bug actually broke.
