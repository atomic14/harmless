// What a setup row READS AS: the answer to the question the row asks.
//
// The one file about a row's VALUE rather than the panel's shape
// (combat-sim-panel.test.ts) or the draft the rows are built from
// (combat-sim.test.ts). It exists because the same fault was found twice in the
// brain column: a row read `PIRATE-ATTACK-T29`, a build artefact rather than a
// way to fly (TODO 41). The fix was wording, not behaviour, and this pins it.
//
// The custom-opposition builder and its per-group rows are gone (the panel was
// too complex — Chris), so the only brain row left is PIRATES FLY. Everything
// here is pure — `setupCells()` and the notes are functions of a draft — so
// what a pilot would read is asserted under node with no browser.
