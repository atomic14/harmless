// The clocks a ship runs whatever it is doing — `NpcShip.tickClocks`.
//
// Its own file because it is its own rule, and because the rule is precisely
// that these do NOT belong to any one branch. Everything else in the suite tests
// a ship DOING something; this tests what is true of it while it does anything
// at all, and the failure it exists to catch is a clock that only ticks down one
// of the paths through `update()`.
//
// That failure has happened twice, which is why the clocks were gathered into
// one call (docs/TODO/77):
//
//   `underFire`      decremented inside `attack()`, the SCRIPTED run. So for
//                    anything flying a trained policy it was a LATCH, not the
//                    decay `UNDER_FIRE_SECONDS` documents: one hit and it sat at
//                    1.2 for the rest of the ship's life.
//   `missileReload`  ticked inside `chooseWeapon`, which `update()` reaches only
//                    down the `aggressiveToPlayer` branch. So a rack froze
//                    mid-reload the moment the pirate stopped being
//                    hostile-and-in-range, and the two-second gap between
//                    launches measured time spent hunting rather than time.
//
// The generator, `regenerate`, is the third and was always correct; what it does
// with elapsed time is `systems.test.ts` and `elite-a-live-combat.test.ts`, and
// what is here is only that the frame runs it. WHAT the two clocks above gate is
// elsewhere too — `break-off.test.ts` for the phase a set `underFire` forces and
// `missile-cap.test.ts` for the reload the cap must not stall. This file is the
// one that says the clocks run.
