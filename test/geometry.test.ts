// TODO 21's gate (elite-a-catalogue.test.ts) proves the IMPORT is the pack's.
// This is the gate on what the renderer does with it: that the conversion is one
// number, that every count still matches the source header, that every face
// came back as a closed polygon, that nothing was dropped without saying so, and
// that the nose ends up along -Z with no per-ship exception.
//
// The counts below are pinned. They are not magic numbers — they are the pack's
// own header fields, read back through the catalogue — but the ones that ARE
// literal (two normal fallbacks on the Splinter, one whole-hull loop on the
// alloy plate, one coplanar merge on the Adder) are the ambiguities this phase
// found and resolved, and a re-import that changed them should fail here rather
// than be believed.
