// The commander's bank-to-turn steering: does it point the nose at the target,
// and does it get there by ROLL and PITCH rather than a yaw the ship has no
// axis for?
//
// The integration that matters — the run cycles under it — is in
// scripted-co-pilot.test.ts, which flies exactly what the Game applies. This
// file pins the steerer's own properties through the SAME pipeline the Game
// uses (bankToTurn -> the player's ramp -> PlayerShip.update): it converges
// from every direction, it never yaws, and it does not chatter near the
// horizontal plane, which is the limit cycle the sphere probe caught.

// below never got the pitch). This sweeps azimuth and elevation and asserts the
// nose lands ON the target from every one.

// WITHIN A GUN CONE, not dead centre. The roll fades near the boresight
// (ROLL_FADE_ANGLE) to stop the seasick oscillation Chris flew, and the cost is
// that a few near-horizontal side directions settle ~2-3 degrees out rather
// than exactly on the pip. That is fine: the co-pilot fires through a cone and
// never needed dead centre (Chris: "we can hit the opponent, it need not be
// dead centre"). The threshold is a gun cone's worth — loose enough for the

// side target rolls GENTLY (the floor) while a genuinely off-axis one still gets
