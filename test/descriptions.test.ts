// Two claims, and they pull in opposite directions on purpose.
//
// The first is that the 1984 data is untouched. This whole feature is a
// decorator, so the test that matters most is the one asserting the thing it
// decorates did not move — `galaxy.test.ts` owns invariant 4, and this file
// re-asserts the narrower version of it that this work could plausibly break.
//
// The second is that a MISSING entry is normal. Every fallback path has to be
// exercised, because the overlay ships empty and stays partial for as long as
// seven of the eight galaxies are ungenerated. A test suite that only proved
// the populated case would pass today and prove nothing.
