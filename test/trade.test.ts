// The outfitter: what a purchase costs you, and what it refuses.
//
// `buyEquipment` is the most complex function in src/ by cyclomatic complexity
// (CCN 27, `uvx lizard src --languages typescript -w`) and until this file it
// had never been executed by a test — the worst pair of numbers in the project,
// on the one code path that moves a player's money. It could always have been
// tested; nothing in it needs a browser. Nobody had.
//
// It writes the save on success, which is the whole reason this is careful:
// every case here runs inside `withoutSaving`, which refuses the write and
// hands back the keys it refused, so the tests assert the save WOULD have
// happened without ever touching a real commander. `test/harness.ts` has
// already put this whole process in the harness namespace, so there is no
// player key to reach in the first place (docs/INVARIANTS.md invariant 3).
