// --- the exercise cannot touch the career ------------------------------------
//
// The safety-critical half of the combat simulator (docs/COMBAT-SIM.md). The one
// rule is that **nothing that happens in the simulator leaves it**, and the load
// -bearing case is that it must not advance you toward E L I T E: a training room
// that credited `kills` or `combatScore` would let a player grind the ladder for
// free, at a station, at no risk.
//
// This runs a FULL exercise headlessly — the real world step, the real gun, the
// real damage model — and kills by every route the game has, dies, breaches a
// hull and collects a bounty. Then it asks four things:
//
//   1. every field of the career commander is unchanged, to the byte
//   2. nothing was written to `elite-web-commander:*` or `elite-web-world:*`,
//      and nothing was REMOVED either — `Game.die` calls `clearWorld()` on
//      purpose, and a simulated death reaching it is data loss, not a leak
//   3. the rng stream is exactly where it was, so the career's next draw is the
//      draw it was about to make
//   4. the career, CONTINUED for 200 steps, is byte-identical to the same 200
//      steps with no excursion at all. A field-by-field comparison passes
//      through every historical snapshot bug in this project; continuing the run
//      does not.
//
// Plus a vacuity guard, which is not optional: the exercise's own record has to
// show kills, shots, damage taken, and an exercise commander whose kill count is
// ABOVE the career's. Without it, "unchanged" proves only that nothing happened.
