// docs/TODO/71 and /72, which are ONE observation change. `observe()` is
// fourteen numbers, none of them the defender's own condition and none of them
// "there is a warhead coming", so a defender at full shields and one hit from
// the escape capsule emitted identical controls in identical geometry — and the
// kill rate was the same to the decimal either side of docs/TODO/63 because
// nothing about the flying COULD change.
//
// The fix is a separate encoder and a separate head rather than two more slots
// on `observe()`, and the whole argument for that choice is one property: the
// two pirate policies are untouched, byte for byte. That is a thing to assert,
// not a thing to hope, and it is what this file is for.
//
// It is its own file rather than blocks in ai.test.ts, missiles.test.ts,
// ui.test.ts and snapshot.test.ts — where the five halves would naturally have
// gone — because the two items are ONE change and the claim is about the whole
// of it: the encoder routes, the new slots carry the right numbers, the button
// answers a real warhead in a real episode, the co-pilot presses it in the game,
// the press survives a save, and NOTHING ELSE PAID FOR ANY OF IT. Split five
// ways, that last clause is the one nobody would be able to read.
