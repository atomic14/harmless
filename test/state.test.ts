// object, so it is persisted. A game constant may live outside it; a value
// worked out at runtime may not.
//
// The signature of a violation is a field initialised FROM THE DICE that sits
// outside the state literal — it cannot be re-derived on restore, because by
// then the stream is somewhere else entirely. Four of these were found by
// hand, one at a time, each costing a round of "two reloads agree with each
// other but not with the run they came from": packOffset, docksHere,
// tumbleAxis and the E.C.M. roll.

    //      in both halves of persistence.ts and captured in neither, so the
    //      prose alone satisfied a name-presence test.
    //   2. It matched a bare SUBSTRING. `sys` — the commander's shields, energy
    //      bank, laser heat and cabin temperature — was satisfied by the `sys`
    //      inside `snap.systems`, so `Object.assign(s.sys, ...)` could be
    //      deleted from the restore and this would still have passed. And
    //      `systems`, the galaxy, passed against `systems: { ...s.sys }`, which
    //      is the SHIP's systems under the same name.
    //
    // So: comments stripped, and the match is `s.<field>` as a whole word —
    // the state being read on the way out and written on the way back — rather
    // than the word appearing anywhere at all.
    //
    // It is still a source scan and it still cannot see whether the VALUE
    // survives; a field captured, restored and then clobbered two lines later
    // passes (that is TODO 46, and what caught it was a behavioural test).
