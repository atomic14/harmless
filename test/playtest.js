/**
 * Autonomous playtest agent — a commander that plays the actual game.
 *
 * The unit tests (`npm test`) guard the maths; this guards the *gameplay*.
 * It drives the real game through `window.__game`, exercising trading,
 * contracts, equipment, hyperspace, combat, docking, hermits and encounters —
 * while continuously asserting invariants that should never break, however
 * the systems interact.
 *
 * Combat is flown by whatever `__policyKit.defendBrain` holds — and since
 * 2026-08-05 that is null: nothing trained ships (src/game/brain-names.ts),
 * so by default the agent flies UNARMED, enduring pirates rather than
 * fighting them. Assign a research candidate to `__policyKit.defendBrain`
 * before running to exercise the combat hand-off.
 *
 * Usage: open the game, open DevTools, paste this file, then:
 *
 *     await __playtest.run({ legs: 20 })          // ~1 min of simulated play
 *     await __playtest.run({ legs: 60, log: true })
 *
 * It backs up your commander first and restores it at the end, and prints
 * a report: what it achieved, what it saw, and every invariant violation.
 *
 * Nothing here reimplements a game rule. This file is pasted into a console
 * and cannot use a static `import`, but it CAN use a dynamic one against the
 * dev server (test/gang-trial.js already does), so every rule it needs is
 * loaded from the module that owns it. It used to carry copies — the market
 * model with the `& 0xff` wrap missing and no living galaxy, the contraband
 * list, the hold's unit table, the chart metric, the player's turn rates —
 * and each one was a measurement quietly taken on a different game.
