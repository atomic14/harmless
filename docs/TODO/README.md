# TODO — active development plans

One file per change. Each is self-contained so a fresh session can open one
file, make the change, verify it, and stop. Work through numbered dependencies
in order; independent items may be delegated in parallel only when their files
and generated outputs do not overlap. How a file here is born, handed to an
agent and signed off is [docs/PROCESS.md](../PROCESS.md) — new plan docs also
carry a **Verification** section, naming the evidence that will show the
change works and plays right, written before the code exists.

TODO 01-16 were completed and checkpointed in commit `0fc8627`. TODO 17-20
were completed through commit `09278b7`.

## Picking this up cold

**[90](90-one-home-for-every-constant.md) is COMPLETE — fourteen slices,
every one byte-identical on all four gates.** `src/constants/` holds 305
constants with their reasoning and measured evidence beside them;
`test/constants.test.ts` is the gate that keeps it true, and every name
still outside the home is a data table, a typed structure, a format
version, prose, drawing or a decided exception, named on the gate's list
with its reason. CLAUDE.md now carries the read-it-do-not-grep-it
instruction, so read `src/constants/` in full before adding any constant
anywhere. The item's file keeps the fourteen Progress entries — what moved,
what stayed and why, and every break that proved a gate — and
[the cleanup list](90-constants-cleanup.md) still holds the OPEN decisions
the survey turned up (the Dodo collision box, the contract range, the
prize-saturation prose, the bounce/launch ordering and the rest): each is a
behaviour change awaiting a decision, none is a refactor.

Nothing is half-finished. Every open item below is a self-contained file.

**Decisions already made, so they are not reopened**: constants move by MEANING
and never by value (`BRAIN_RATE_RAMP` and the commander's `RATE_RAMP` are both
4.1396 and must never be fused — one is a feel setting, the other is what every
shipped brain was fitted at). CSS is out of 90's scope and is [93](93-one-home-for-the-phosphor.md).
Legacy and migration handling was deleted outright rather than preserved, three
times over, because nobody but Chris has ever played this game — the cleanup
list records what went and why, so it is not helpfully reinstated.

## The closed-loop queue (2026-08-08)

The process is now the closed loop in [docs/PROCESS.md](../PROCESS.md): one
feature in flight at a time, background agents building, verification per the
plan doc. Triage note, same date: the open training-fidelity and
training-methodology items below (70-74, 78-80, 82, 84, 85, 91) describe the
training pipeline, and nothing trained has shipped since the line was retired
on 2026-08-05 — they are research items until a retrain is deliberately
wanted, and the queue prefers items a player can feel.

**Checkpoint, 2026-08-09 (session web-elite-harmless, closed clean):** main
is `ce58a8f` + the commit carrying this line, pushed; working tree clean; NO

Landed today: 97, 98, 99, 100, 102 and the process revision; issues #12-14
closed; CI green throughout. **105's orchestrator script now exists**
(`tools/cycle.ts`, dry-run tested; drive an item with
`node --experimental-strip-types tools/cycle.ts <number>`); 105 stays open
until its shakedown — run item 103 through it end to end, which also
retires 103. Queue order: **103 via the script** (the shakedown), then 104
(constants catalogue), 101, 92, #8, #7, 86, 89, 96, 95, #9, #10, 68. Every
open item is a self-contained plan doc in this directory. The next
supervisor session starts from this file plus docs/PROCESS.md, not from any
chat history.

## The combat trainer

Progress: **9 / 9 complete**. `T` at any station is where Chris playtests, so
this is the room that has to be good. The findings came from a walk through the
live panel plus the screens' own code, after the Elite-A phase changed what the
numbers mean.

31 to 36 are done: the panel is grouped, the career switch is fenced, a brain
row says what that brain does in a fight, you can tell you are in an exercise,
the report shows how the OPPOSITION flew — their speed, the spread of ranges
they held and their completed attack runs, on the same definitions
`train/flight-probe.ts` reads — ENTER on the report holds two records side by
side, refusing to difference a pair that is not one fight flown twice, and an
exercise now opens in front of the pilot at a stated range, with the geometry on
the record and the one scenario that opens behind you saying so. 37 is done too:
a tap that arrives in a busy frame is carried to the next one instead of being
thrown away, bounded so that only a key something is already reading keeps a
backlog and never more than three of it. Do 39 next; 38 is independent of the
rest and can go at any point.

## From the code review (2026-08-02)

Progress: **16 / 16 complete**. Five reviewers with separate lenses; every
finding below was verified against the code before it was written down. Two
reviewers found item 43 independently, by different routes.

43 is done: career identity has one home — `SaveRecord.career`, which is what
the `save:auto:<CAREER>:*` keys are built from — the snapshot carries none, and
a boot no longer writes a docked checkpoint, because a boot has not docked.
`test/save-transfer.test.ts` is the coverage that module never had.

44 and 45 are done, and they are one job because they are the same sentence
read twice: a save operation must not act on the strength of a write it never
checked. Migration now removes a legacy key only once the copy reads back — the
pre-slots commander included, which a full store used to read, write nowhere and
delete — and NEW COMMANDER aims the boot pointer AWAY from the shelf instead of
clearing it, because a cleared pointer means "lost" and `bootSave` answers that
with the career you just asked to put down.

53 then deleted the migration 44 had just hardened, which is not a reversal: 44
fixed a live bug in code that was shipping, and 53 asked who the code was for.
Nobody but us has ever played, so the answer was nobody, and a careful migration
serving nobody is still a hazard — 44 is the proof. `migrateLegacySaves` and its
two helpers are gone, `SaveRecord.from` with them, and the old keys are LEFT in
whatever browser holds them: a delete has no write to verify itself against, so
clearing them would be the one shape 44 says not to write. Nothing reads them,
and a store holding only them boots a fresh commander because `parseSaveId`
refuses their shape. The write-then-verify-then-delete order survives everywhere
a delete still follows a write.

46 is done. A restore now beats the dock that follows it: `Station.dock` takes
a `DockArrival` — you flew in, you booted with nothing to resume, or a world
came off the shelf — and only the last of the three declines to roll a market
and a bulletin board, because the restore stocked both from the snapshot four
lines earlier. That closes the combat trainer's reroll button with no special
case for the trainer, which tears down through the same restore. The skipped
draws move no seeded outcome: `Persistence.restore` assigns `snap.rng` on the
line after the one that reaches the station, so a resumed dock's stream is
replaced whatever it drew. `test/persistence.test.ts` is the coverage that
module never had, and it asserts the property the name-presence grep in
`test/state.test.ts` cannot see — that the VALUE came back.

47 is done, and the shape it wanted was already in the file: the world step
reports `playerDealt` the way it reports `npcFired`, and the exercise credits
it. The two directions have separate closed lists now — `DamageSource` for the
five things that can hurt you, `DealtSource` for the four you can hurt a ship
with — and one function, `damage-dealt.ts`'s `dealToNpc`, spends the points and
measures what came OFF the bank, so a 250-point warhead into a Sidewinder
credits the 73 it had rather than the 250 it spent, which is what the laser
path always did. The energy bomb is the one path that never touches the step,
so game.ts hands it over beside the kill it already handed over. No damage
number moved: the campaign is byte-identical and the ai gates are unmoved. The
export schema is at 3, because `damageDealt` kept its name and changed what it
covers.

48 is done, and it was two halves of one boundary. `energyLow()` in
`systems.ts` is now the only test for "into the last bank", so the shield
cut-off, the ENERGY LOW flash and the red segment cannot disagree — they did,
at exactly 64, where the shields froze and the console stayed quiet. And
`destroyed` is a fact about THIS hit (`reachedHull && energy <= 0`) rather than
about the bank, with the E.C.M. refusing at `<=` its cost so no path can leave
the bank at zero with the ship still flying. `test/energy-low.test.ts` walks
all 256 values of the bank through the real `regenerate`, a real `WorldStep`
frame and a real HUD frame; the campaign is byte-identical.

50 is done, and it went the way the item asked: fewer homes rather than a
longer list to keep in step. A command key is `BINDINGS` in `controls.ts`; what
it DOES is one line in `command-help.ts` beside it, welded by
`Record<Command, CommandHelp>`, so a command nobody has written down does not
compile. The `?` panel, the manual page and the docked menu — the one with a
click path — are painted from that pair by `ui/key-help.ts` and hold no copy of
a key, which is three homes gone and the two undocumented keys (the distress
beacon, ⇧Y) documented everywhere at once. The README is the one surface left
in prose, and `test/key-help.test.ts` holds it to the table in both directions.

51 is done. The MARKET ESTIMATE panel and the campaign harness each carried the
1984 price formula rewritten; `contracts.ts`'s `marketEstimate` runs
`galaxy.ts`'s own model over all 256 fluctuations with the living galaxy's
pressure on top, and both call it. The old expression was out by more than 5 Cr
on 113 of the 4,352 system/commodity rows and by 38.4 on Teanrebi Narcotics; the
sweep is now exact to the tenth of a credit the game quotes in. The screen also
says what it is: an AVERAGE with the RANGE its rolls span, because the mean of a
market that wraps at 0xff describes no single visit. Trade decisions moved, as
they had to — a trader's median net worth 7426.6 → 7577.4 Cr, cash in hand 331.9
→ 764.1, 37/40 → 38/40 solvent. `npm run campaign -- 40 60 all` has one failing
check in the BOUNTY HUNTER cohort, and it fails identically before and after: a
hunter buys no cargo, so its figures are byte-identical either way.

54 is done, and both halves of it were one spread. `adoptSaveFile` copied a
parsed file into the record it wrote, so `v` and `savedAt` came off a stranger's
disk — and `readSave` refuses a record whose version is not this build's, so a
file from another build was written, pointed at, announced, and then did not
exist. The version is checked where the file is PARSED now, which is the only
place that can refuse it out loud, and the record is MINTED through
`makeRecord`: only the world and the commander come from the file, because only
they are the file's to give. `savedAt` is the import, not the claim, which
matters because the flight ring evicts by it and a lost pointer resumes the
newest record. The second half was TODO 44's third `setBootId` call site, and it
is honoured beside the reload it authorises. `test/save-transfer.test.ts`
asserts the shelf's own contract from the bytes: every record on it is readable
by `readSave`, which `listSaves()` cannot be asked because it drops exactly what
the question is about.

57 is done, and it is the one that made the tree smaller. `src/ai-training/brains/`
held 34 weights files, the game imported 9, three flew; it holds exactly the
three now and `npm test` fails on a fourth file, on a shipped one going missing,
and on any file in `src/` other than `game/brains.ts` importing weights — which
is the rule the combat viewer broke twice. `/viewer` is the combat viewer and
opens on it, `/gallery` is the 38 hulls and opens on them, neither has a mode key
or the other's controls, and every row the viewer offers flies a shipped brain or
a stated control, built from one table so a label and its weights cannot come
apart. `BrainSelection` is two flags rather than eight; a save carrying one of
the six deleted ones loads, is not migrated, and flies the shipped brains.
docs/TRAINING-LOG.md carries a dated note and is otherwise untouched: the figures
stand as the record of what was measured. The play bundle is 35.4 kB smaller
gzipped and the viewer 56.4 kB, with the shipped brains and therefore the game's
difficulty unchanged — `npm run campaign` and the `test/ai.test.ts` gates print
identical numbers before and after.

Order: 49 is why several of these survived — 46 is item 1 on its list, a guard
that greps persistence.ts for a field NAME while the value is clobbered four
lines later — so it is worth doing early rather than last.

## Content

Progress: **2 / 2 complete**. The 1984 galaxy says one line about each world.
There is a second paragraph beside it now, written offline by a model and
committed — the same pipeline `tools/species-prompts.ts` already uses for the
inhabitant portraits, for the same reason: the game deploys as a static site,
so nothing can call a model at build or play time.

Galaxy 1 is described, all 256 worlds, generated on Sonnet 5 for $0.95 (the
token counts are in the file; the money is only ever printed, because a token
count stays true and a price list does not). Every entry is optional by design
— a missing one renders exactly what the game rendered before — so galaxies
2-8 can follow whenever, and a refused record costs nothing:
`npm run generate:descriptions -- 2 --model claude-sonnet-5`.

`/encyclopaedia` is the same corpus as something to read rather than something
to find in-game: the 256-world chart, filterable, with every entry also written
into the HTML at build time so the page is a complete reference work with no
JavaScript at all. It is the first page to have invariant 1 enforced by a test.

The measurement worth keeping is that reading four entries proved nothing. The
first full run was excellent one world at a time and a template in bulk — 207
of 256 mentioned arrival, because the prompt had asked for it. Counting found
it; a gate holds it at zero now. **Read the set, not the sample.**

## From the bug sweep (2026-08-03)

Progress: **1 / 1 complete**. A sweep after TODO 59 with every gate green —
2748 unit tests, the campaign, the Elite-A alignment gate, portability at zero
contaminated — plus the browser playtest, which is the one that found
something.

One defect was found and fixed inside the sweep rather than written up: HTML
escaping had grown a second home. `src/engine/escape-html.ts` was written
during TODO 59 with a header claiming to be the single home for it, and
`ui/screens.ts` was never migrated onto it — so two implementations shipped,
already diverged (one escaped a double quote, the other did not). That is this
project's named failure with a new hat on, so it now has a test that fails if a
third appears.

60 is done, and the cause was none of the obvious ones. The step budget was
tested first and cleared: at 60,000 steps the agent still spent 90% of them
parked at speed 0. It was a mutual standstill — the approach yielded to any
ship within 320 units, and `npc.ts` lets traders come to rest, so both sides
waited forever. Two further defects fell out of it: `alignRoll` aimed the wings
at the station's local X when the slot test wants local Y (the same bug in
`train/jameson-autopilot.js`, whose header promises alignment it never
delivered), and `openHermitTrade()` pushed the market screen twice — a real
player-facing bug since the screen-host migration, where leaving a rock hermit
needs two Escapes.

## Training fidelity, and one decision the guard is forcing

Chris, 2026-08-03: *"Training should match the 'real world' otherwise it's
always going to be wrong."*

It started as three items from one question — why a scripted NPC can fire a
missile in the game and not in a training episode — and answering two of them
turned it into six. The answer is that invariant 5's "one
combat model" covers the DECISION half of combat and not the RESOLUTION half:
`world-step.ts` and `ai-training/scenario.ts` are two implementations of
invariant 15's contract, and they have silently diverged on the weapon, the
missile rack and shield regeneration. 62 and 63 were the two known divergences —
**both are closed**, and **64 is done**: there is ONE resolver now,
`game/fire-resolution.ts`, called by both, over a four-member `FireWorld` each
side implements — the seam this codebase already uses for the platform, the
orchestrator and a sky to put a warhead in. The rules above it are the rack, the
dice, the damage and the shield face (`game/shield-face.ts`, one line that had two
homes and agreed); everything left with the callers is a tracer, a bang and a
tally. `test/fire-resolution.test.ts` is the mechanism that would have caught 62
and 63 and stops the next one — the same `FireEvent` and the same seed through
BOTH callers — and it is checked for vacuity by gutting the resolver and by
re-growing a copy in one caller. The game is byte-identical over 7,000 traced
frames; the trainer moved in 4 episodes of 120, from the one row 64 closed that
had a number in it (the range the hit dice read).

Doing 62 turned up a fourth divergence nobody was looking for, which is 64's whole
argument restated: **73**, a training pirate never hands over to the scripted
break-off, so it never completes a pass and can never earn a missile the way the
game intends. It is the one row of 64's table that does not read "same", it is
left open deliberately — closing it changes what every genome is scored against —
and it is where the seam goes next: `NpcShip.update()` is still the only place
that composes "pick a flight, then pick a weapon".

**74** is 64's own prediction coming true on the way out. 64 says of its table
"there is no reason to believe the list is complete", and finishing it turned up a
fifth divergence pointing the OTHER way: the episode's armed freighter shoots back
with the range curve where the game's armed trader rolls the flat
`NPC_VS_NPC_HIT`, so it lands 0.754 of its shots against the sky's 0.500 at the
ranges a fight is actually fought at. It is outside 64's seam — the shooter there
is the episode's target, not an `NpcShip` — and it feeds `fitnessDefend`,
`fitnessPack` and every defence-probe table, so it is a decision about which rule
is right rather than a refactor.

61 is decided and done: **deleted**. Chris, 2026-08-03. `pirate-attack-e1` was
restored to be compared against `pirate-attack-g3` as the solo pirate policy, and
`d563e3d` retired that job — the scripted attack run is what ships for solo
pirates and gangs alike, so the candidate was a candidate for a post that no
longer exists. The weights, the `BrainName`, the character line, both pickers'
rows, the `brains.ts` import and the `BrainSelection.passes` flag are all gone;
`train/evaluate.ts`'s `CANDIDATES` is empty again. docs/TRAINING-LOG.md keeps
every figure `e1` ever measured, with a dated note saying the file is no longer
there to re-run them against. A save carrying `passes` still loads, is not
migrated and flies the shipped brains, which is TODO 57's precedent, and
`test/brain-names.test.ts` now asserts it for `passes` too.

63 is done, and it changed a baseline rather than a brain: the episode's target
runs the whole of `systems.ts`'s `regenerate` now, so **every defence and evade
figure in docs/TRAINING-LOG.md before 2026-08-04 is incomparable with one after
it** — the entry there says so rather than re-baselining quietly. The defence
phase was retrained twice at run 19's budget and **neither shipped**: both
champions validate at 99.8-99.9% of her pools left and both are worse than the
incumbent on held-out seeds, which is 65's arithmetic doing exactly what 65 says
it does. 65 is done now and the retrain after it found a policy that kills seven
times as much; the two things 63 left open are still open and neither is 63's to
close — they are **70** and **71** below.

70 and 71 came out of 63 and are the two things it could not close. 70: a gang of
three killed the armed scripted trader in 21 of 60 episodes and now kills her in
0, so `fitnessPack`'s kill bonus — **51% of the shipped pack policy's fitness** —
is a constant zero, and it blocks a meaningful pack retrain. 71: `observe()` is
fourteen numbers and own health is not one of them, so "break off and heal" is
not learnable however 65 fixes the selection — which is why the kill rate was
identical either side of 63.

62 is done, and like 63 it changed a world rather than a brain. A training pirate
calls `NpcShip.chooseWeapon` now, the trainer's resolver reads `shot.weapon`, and
the round is spent through `ordnance.ts`'s own `launchNpcMissile` over an
`OrdnanceWorld` an episode supplies — no second missile model, which was the one
thing the item forbade. `jameson-defend-g1` fell from **99.2% of her pools left to
90.1%** over 240 held-out fights and died in **6 of them where it had died in
none**, and `npm run survivability` moved off 0% destroyed at every gang size for
the first time: four organised pirates now kill her in 8.3 seconds, which is
Chris's real 9.1-second death appearing in the trainer. `EPISODE_SCHEMA` is **3**;
a schema-2 record describes a world where only a laser could reach her.

62 leaves two things open and each has its own file. **72**: she has no E.C.M. and
no output that could press it, so missiles are currently undodgeable in training —
which is the same fidelity fault as 62 pointing the other way, and it wants 65 and
71 first. **73**: brain-flown pirates make **zero passes** in an episode because
there is no handover to the scripted break-off at `BRAIN_HANDOVER_RANGE`, so the
"tougher than you thought" launch — the one that rewards ENGAGING — is unreachable
for exactly the ships the game sends at a player. 62 did NOT restore 70's kill
bonus for the same reason: three shipped pack pirates against the armed scripted
trader still launch **0** missiles and still kill her **0** times in 60.

## The attack run, and what comes after it

`d563e3d` gave every hostile a three-phase attack run. These are the four things
it left open — two measured faults in the run's geometry, the design it makes
possible, and one piece of wording nobody could read.

- [x] 66 — [The pass aims where you were, not where you will be](66-the-pass-aims-where-you-were.md) — combat bug · medium · small
- [x] 67 — [Short attack runs are not flyable, so the rhythm is fixed at ~9s](67-short-attack-runs-are-not-flyable.md) — combat feel · medium · medium
- [ ] 68 — [A vocabulary of tactics, not one behaviour](68-a-vocabulary-of-tactics.md) — combat feel/design · medium · large
- [x] 69 — [The setup panel says "HULL (0)" and means "ask the hull"](69-the-panel-says-hull-zero.md) — UI/UX · low · small

66 is done, and it needed a tool before it needed a fix. Nothing in the training
world both TRANSLATED and stayed in the fight — `holding` sits at 42, and
`scripted` and `runner` both settle at ~397 against a pirate's ~240 and are
never caught again — so there was no way to ask the question the item is about.
`train/ram-probe.ts` and a `weaving` target are that way: five ships, contact
counted where the ram is billed rather than divided out of a damage total.

The aim point now leads (`game/pass-aim.ts`, which is where the run's aim went
when it had grown to a third of `break-off.ts`) and the miss distance stretches
with the range and the closure, so a pass opens the gap it always claimed to.
Against five ships and a target that holds — the closest model of how Chris
actually flies — contact fell from 1.15 to 0.42 an episode, 132 points to 48;
ship-on-ship contact fell 67%; the passes count did not move. It cost 1.5 points
of the commander's pools in `defence-probe`, where simply raising the constant
to 130 for the same result costs 3.6. The honest caveat is in the item's own
report: the geometry the item PREDICTED — a fast head-on merge eating the offset
— is real but is not what was producing Chris's rams, and against a target
translating at 400 the fix buys a quarter more merges at the same contact per
merge rather than less contact.

67 is done, and the item's diagnosis was half of the cause. The half it named
is real: `extending` steered for nothing, so the whole 180 had to happen in the
closing leg. `game/extend-arc.ts` is the curve that fixes it — a heading held at
a ramping angle to the OUTWARD radial, which keeps the range opening (so the
phase machine cannot be starved and the curve cannot become an orbit) while the
nose comes round. The half it did not name was bigger: **the aim point was on
whichever side the ship's own +X happened to point**, which is the far side of
the target about half the time, and a run aimed at the far side is a run through
the middle. Worse, it ran away — steering at a point defined by your own +X
moves the point, so the nose sat 25-60 degrees off the aim for seconds while the
ship turned at its cap. That is what "an intended 110 delivered as 75" was, and
what the old band table was really measuring. `passOffset` takes the side off
the HEADING now: the side the ship is already stepping to, which no run has to
cross the target to reach.

Together they take the merge-to-merge gap Chris asked about from **9.47s to
7.22s** with the run-out still apexing at 792, and contact does not pay for it —
it falls. One pirate against a target that holds: 4.4 points an episode to
**0.0**, closest approach 47 to 108. Five against a moving one (`ram-probe`):
holds 0.38 rams an episode to 0.17, evades 0.63 to 0.20, weaves 0.38 to **0.05**.
The band is 500-850 and `EXTEND_RANGE_MIN` came down as the item asked, with its
table re-derived over the five bands that are now all flyable.

The price is a threshold and a point of balance, both stated rather than hidden.
`PASS_FAR` is **600**: at 900 the new runs would have counted 12% of the merges
they actually fly, so every attack-run figure in the game and in flight-probe
would have read near zero for a model that had just got better — the archived
rows in `train/logs/todo32/` are now a record of a different threshold as well
as a different flight model. And a shorter rhythm is more pressure: over 240
held-out defence fights `jameson-defend-g1` keeps **88.7%** of her pools where
she kept 90.1%. The decomposition says which half did it — the aim fix alone
takes her to 91.8%, and the arc's extra runs per minute take her back down —
so it is the rate, not the ramming, and it is the thing to fly before keeping.
No retrain is owed (no combat number moved; the shipped policies do not run
`attack()` outside `BRAIN_HANDOVER_RANGE`), but the defence brain was fitted
against a slower opponent and that is a retrain that might now find something.


69 is done: a delegated row reads `FROM THE HULL — NONE` / `FROM THE HULL — 60%`
and a set one reads `0` / `60%`, so the mode is words and the number after it is
a consequence. `null` still means "whatever this hull carries" — the behaviour
did not move, only the wording — and one `setOrHull()` phrases both rows, which
is the whole of it: the record never quoted the string, so there was no second
home to keep in step. The assertions went to a new `test/combat-sim-rows.test.ts`
along with TODO 41's, because "what a row READS AS" is a different question from
the panel's shape and the panel's file was full of the second one.

65 came out of trying to act on 62-64 and failing. Two retrains across a wider
training distribution both came out worse than the shipped brain, and tripling
the search budget was not the answer: the defend phase picked its champion on
pools-left alone, where killing a whole pirate was worth 3 points and losing 1%
of your pools cost 10. Under that rule shooting is strictly irrational, which
is CLAUDE.md's long-standing "evades superbly and shoots badly" — not a property
of the brain, a property of the selection.

**65 is done.** `train/selection.ts` is the rule now — `0.75 x outcome +
0.25 x shaped`, a STATED ratio where the old ±499 clamp let shaping contribute
1.9%, and a defender's outcome is `0.6 x the pools she kept + 0.4 x the share of
the attacking force she broke`, cumulative rather than terminal (which also
closes 63's second inversion, where clearing a fight early scored WORSE because
she healed for less of the clock) and zero if she died. `evade` deliberately
keeps no fighting term and says why. `test/selection.test.ts` asserts the
ordering on two hand-built genomes that differ in exactly one weight — the bias
on the fire head — and asserts that the rule this replaced ranked them the other
way round.

The retrain found the brain the old rule could not: `jameson-defend-t65c` kills
**41.0%** of its attackers against the shipped brain's 5.7%, on held-out seeds,
and takes less cumulative damage doing it. It is **not promoted**: it is
destroyed in 42 of 800 held-out fights against 19, which is not equal
survivability. Every death of every defence policy has a warhead in it, so that
column is **72**'s — until she can answer a missile it measures how many
warheads a policy attracts — and the ceiling on the fighting itself is **71**'s.

## From the independent AI review (2026-08-04)

An outside read of every NPC-AI and scripting path — the scripted flight model,
the weapons and their resolution, the four encoders and the three shipped
policies, the training pipeline, the probes, and the tests that are supposed to
hold all of it — after commits `83426d0`..`dbc7f3c`. Every item below was
CONFIRMED by running something, and each file carries the command and the output.

The method that found half of them was a mutation sweep: eighteen deliberate
breaks to rules in `npc.ts`, `break-off.ts`, `pass-aim.ts`, `extend-arc.ts`,
`separation.ts`, `gunnery.ts`, `shield-face.ts`, `tactic-choice.ts`,
`observation.ts` and `selection.ts`, each run against `npm test` and restored.
Fifteen of the eighteen were caught. **Three were not, and one more constant —
`BRAIN_RATE_DECAY`, which governs how every brain-flown ship and the purchasable
combat computer bleeds off a turn — can be moved with no test failing at all.**

## One home for every constant, and what the survey found on the way

Chris, 2026-08-04: a single namespaced source of truth for constants, *"it
doesn't matter if you can't find a problem now — it's a ticking time bomb"*, and
be very aware of constants that should be the same and have quietly diverged.

**90 is the work.** Phase 1 is done: five agents read every hand-written source
file in the project start to finish, with grep banned — because a diverged pair
shares neither a name nor a value, so no search can find one. 539 constants.
The inventory and every finding is
[the survey](90-constants-survey.md); the plan and the decided shape are
[the item](90-one-home-for-every-constant.md). CSS was ruled out of 90's scope
and is 93.

91, 92 and 93 are what the survey turned up that is not a refactor. Each is a
real change to what the game does, and each lands on its own.

- [x] 90 — [One home for every constant](90-one-home-for-every-constant.md) — architecture · high · large
- [ ] 91 — [Delete the target-speed input, and retrain](91-delete-the-target-speed-input.md) — training fidelity/AI · high · large
- [ ] 92 — [The lead marker assumes every target is a freighter](92-the-lead-marker-assumes-a-freighter.md) — combat bug/UI · medium · small
- [ ] 93 — [One home for the phosphor](93-one-home-for-the-phosphor.md) — architecture/UI · medium · medium
- [x] 94 — [Parse a save at the door, and refuse it whole](94-parse-a-save-at-the-door.md) — correctness/saves · medium · medium
- [ ] 95 — [Save only at stations, and re-roll the sky on restore](95-save-only-at-stations.md) — architecture/saves · high · large

94 is done, in the shape Chris decided. `parseSnapshot(unknown): WorldSnapshot`
lives beside the interface it is the one door to, checking what has invariants
— the version, the branded ids, every fleet index, the galaxy and system
bounds the rebuild would hang on, arities and finiteness — and passing the
deliberately-opaque halves through on presence and container shape alone.
`Persistence.restore` parses at its own first line, so a refused restore
modifies nothing: capture-before and capture-after are byte-identical where
the commander used to be replaced seven steps before the throw. `resume()`
still answers a refusal with false (its version pre-check went — the parse is
the rule's one home), and `restoreSnapshot` throws to the harness that handed
it junk, with the session untouched. The gate is `test/snapshot-parse.test.ts`
and it cannot rot: it deletes and corrupts every key of a REAL captured
snapshot, walked off the object rather than a list. A parser that accepts
everything fails 15 of its checks; removing the parse from `restore` fails
the untouched-session assertion; the round-trip identity and seeded-fleet
properties held throughout.

The three findings worth knowing without opening the survey. **The HUD leads
every locked target at 220**, a freighter's cruise, so it under-leads a
Fer-de-Lance by a third and a Thargon by more — that is 92, and Chris chose the
real speed plus a session at the stick. **A pirate brain reads a different
target speed in training than in the game**, because `brains.ts` floors it at
150 and the trainer does not, on the one input `brains.ts` says the policy has
latched onto — that is 91, and Chris chose to delete the input rather than
close the divergence, which costs a retrain of all three policies. And **NPCs
fly through the Dodo's hull**: the player's collision box is `dockZ + 50` with
the measurement beside it, the NPC one a bare `+ 40`, and the Dodo's tallest
vertices are at 243 against a 196 plane.

The trap that makes "review by meaning, never by value" non-negotiable:
`BRAIN_RATE_RAMP` and the commander's `RATE_RAMP` are both **4.1396** and must
never be fused. One is a feel setting; the other is what every shipped brain was
fitted at. A pass that unified identical values would put every policy out of
distribution with nothing going red.

**75 is done, and the answer was to delete the reason.** "The gang is losing —
one of us is already gone" was the third way into `npcMissileEmergency`, and it
was unreachable in the sky: `matesLost` counted dead ships in `world.npcs` and
every kill path splices the ship out of that array inside the same statement, so
no NPC has ever run a decision in a frame where a dead mate was still there. A
training episode never prunes its fleet, so it was the one world in which the
reason fired at all. Of the three answers the item offered — a counter on the
world, a latch on each ship, or deletion — Chris chose deletion, because the
other two turn the rule ON for the first time, in the direction of more warheads,
in exactly the fights already going badly for the player, and nobody had decided
the gang should be more dangerous. `matesLost()` is gone from `npc.ts`, the
argument is gone from `chooseWeapon` and from `Episode.step`, and nothing in
`src/` or `train/` calls it any more; what is left is a paragraph in
`missile-launch.ts` beside the two surviving reasons saying that a third one
existed, why it could never fire, and what a real version of it would have to
start from.

**The sky did not move and the trainer did.** `npm run campaign` is identical
either side — 40 commanders × 60 legs, every row to the last decimal, with only
the wall-clock line differing — which is the empirical half of the claim that
the reason was already dead in the live game. In training it is worth 87 fewer
warheads across the defence probe's 1,200 held-out fights (967 before against
880), and 352 against 225 over 800 defend episodes flown against policy pirates
rather than the scripted default. The attack phase is byte-identical over 200
episodes, because a one-ship fleet never had a mate to lose. Terminal pools kept
move 98.4% to 98.0%, the cumulative figure the champion is actually selected on
does not move at all (86.1 against 86.2 points per episode), and the `died`
column is 0 of 1,200 either side. `EPISODE_SCHEMA` goes **4 → 5** anyway,
because the field says which world a row was measured in; docs/TRAINING-LOG.md
carries the columns.

**Two reasons are left, and one of them is still dead in the trainer.** Both are
pinned now: deleting `hull <= MISSILE_LAST_STAND_HULL` fails 23 assertions and
deleting `passes >= MISSILE_COMMIT_PASSES` fails 5, each checked by breaking it
and restoring it. But `passesMade` is **73**'s item — a BRAIN-flown pirate in
training hands over to the scripted break-off inside `BRAIN_HANDOVER_RANGE` and
completes no passes at all — so for a policy genome the desperation hull line is
now the only way a warhead leaves a rail, which is what the 352 → 225 drop is
made of. A scripted pirate still earns its second reason by flying passes, which
is why the same deletion costs the probe only 9%. 70 is the same shape a third
time. Deleting `matesLost` closed the divergence between the two worlds; it did
not make either of them richer.

**76, 83 and 87 were the mutation sweep's three misses**, and they are not the
same kind of gap. 76 is a whole rule module — `separation.ts`, with its own swept
constants and three call sites in the attack run — that no test imports at all.
83 is one guard on a stated fairness rule with a recorded failure behind it. 87
is three assertions that expand to `f(x) === f(x)` in the file whose own comment
says "assert the rule rather than the copies". All three are closed below.

**76 is done, and the module was right — the comment beside it was not.**
`test/separation.test.ts` is 29 assertions, and the pure half of it asserts the
rule rather than the arithmetic: the urgency curve as a constant slope over
twenty steps rather than as `1 - d / SEPARATION_RANGE` written back down, the
direction as a unit vector from the NEAREST mate against two far ones placed so
that a blend would point somewhere else entirely, and the two guards — the last
of them six hull separations from 0 to 0.5 units apart, because zero is the case
that would otherwise put `NaN, NaN, NaN` into `object.position` and take the
ship out of the world for the rest of the session. `npm test` goes from **3,024
to 3,054 passed, 0 failed**. The review's own mutation,
`if (nearest === null || true) return 0;`, fails **18** of them; deleting the
identity skip fails 2, deleting the zero-distance guard fails 1 and prints the
three NaNs, taking the last mate in range instead of the nearest fails 1, and
bending the curve from linear to quadratic fails 3.

The flying half is three merges, one per leg of the attack run, each flown twice
— once with the pair in each other's fleet and once with the fleet empty, which
is the same fixture with the push at zero. Closest approach goes **49.4 → 87.9**
in `passing`, **49.0 → 87.6** in `closing` and **45.4 → 76.8** in `extending`,
and the one contact `collisions.ts` reports in each control becomes none.
Removing any ONE of the three call sites in `npc.ts` fails exactly one of those
three, a different one each time, and fails it with `0.0 units wider` — with the
fleet unseen the two arms are the same run to the last bit, which is what makes
the control worth having. It lives beside its subsystem rather than in
`test/npc.test.ts` as the item suggested: the rule being asserted is
separation.ts's rather than a fact about `NpcShip`, and npc.test.ts is 361 lines
with a 400-line ceiling over it.

**`matePositions` said one thing and did another, and the comment was the one
telling the truth.** It claimed "everything solid and alive except itself and
the thing it is attacking" while excluding only `this`, the dead and the inert,
so inside `SEPARATION_RANGE` a police ship steered away from the pirate it was
attacking. Two measurements decided it, over 160 seeded engagements of each
pairing against a target that holds still. It was deleting the `ram` tactic:
`tactics.ts` has a doomed ship aim at the hull rather than beside it
(`missDistance: 0`, `aimsToHit: true`) and `tactic-choice.ts` goes to the trouble
of exempting it from the clearance gate, and pinned to `ram` a hunter connected
**5 times and 0 times in 160 engagements** where without the push it connects
**13.3 and 11.0 times per engagement** — one file exempting the tactic and
another quietly vetoing it. It was also the second home of a distance
`pass-aim.ts` already owns: the merge a run delivered sat at a **149.7/149.6**
median against the **110** the aim asked for, and reads **115.2/113.5** with one
rule deciding. The price is contact between two NPCs, 0 → **0.031** and
**0.125** an engagement, against the 0.33 an episode `tactics.ts` had already
measured and accepted for the commander.

Nothing the player meets moved, and that is measured rather than assumed. `npm
run campaign` is identical to the last decimal, `npm run elite-a` is 480 passed
and `npm run portability` 0 contaminated. `npm run ram-probe` is byte-identical
too — and the item is wrong to offer it as the end-to-end number for this
decision, because an `Episode`'s fleet holds pirates and nothing else and its
target is passed as `'player'`, so `matePositions` never contained the target
there and the probe cannot see the change at all. The only sky the decision
touches is the live one, where `view.fleet` is every NPC and `npcTarget` is one
of them. `separation.ts` is on `test/ai.test.ts`'s `PURE` list now, which is the
one free line the item asked for.

**83 is done**, in a new `test/missile-cap.test.ts` rather than in
`test/missiles.test.ts` — that file is about a warhead LEAVING the rail and this
rule is about one that may not, which is a second thing and would have taken it
past the ceiling. Twenty-four assertions, and no line of `src/` moved: the rule
was already right, it was only unguarded. `npm test` goes from **2,982 to 3,006
passed, 0 failed**. The review's own mutation, `if (missileInbound && false)`,
fails **13** of them and nothing else in the suite — which is the whole finding
restated as a gate. The other ways the parts can drift were broken too, because
a gate nobody has broken is not one: moving the `missileInbound` read inside the
NPC loop in `world-step.ts` fails 2 of the new assertions and drops the gang from
8 warheads to 2, and arming the reload before refusing — the guard behind
`npcMissileEmergency` rather than in front of it — fails 6. The loop mutation
reaches one older test as a symptom, `missiles.test.ts`'s "it kills her", which
is a lethality figure and not the rule; the arming mutation reaches a selection
comparison in `selection.test.ts` that turns on 0.3 points of shaped score.
(These counts are the re-measurement taken when **77** moved the reload tick out
of `chooseWeapon`; before it they were 14, 4 for a fourth mutation that no longer
exists — "the guard ahead of the reload tick" — and 7.)

The gang case is four hurt Pythons flown through the real `WorldStep` for 900
frames. (It was four and a dead wingman, so that `matesLost > 0` outlasted them
healing back past the hull line; 75 deleted both the reason and the corpse, and
the figures below are unchanged by that.) With the sky to themselves they spend all **8**
rounds; **898** of those 900 frames have a warhead up and **0** launches happen
in them, the longest unbroken silence being **8.1s**, or 4.0x the 2s reload — so
it is the sky holding them and not their own rails. The same seed with a decoy
warhead launched through `Ordnance.launchHostile` and parked 30,000 units out
launches **nothing** and ends with every rack full. Over 12 seeds that is 96
warheads against 0, and the answer does not change at 60 seeds: **480 against
0**, with 53,880 occupied frames and not one launch in any of them.

One thing in the item is wrong and the test asserts the opposite. It suggests
adding "two pirates in ONE frame cannot both launch"; the once-per-frame read
gives exactly the reverse, as `scenario.ts:908` says in a comment and as its own
"what is actually failing" bullet says two paragraphs earlier. Four ships do
launch on a frame that began clear, and `mostInOneFrame > 1` is now the
assertion that catches the read moving inside the loop. The item is also wrong
that `chooseWeapon` spends the round — it decides and reports, and
`launchNpcMissile` spends — so "spends no round" is pinned at the unit level as
an unstarted reload and end-to-end by the capped gang's four full racks.

**77 is done, and the fix was to give the ship one clock instead of three.**
`underFire` decayed in exactly one place — inside `attack()`, the scripted run —
so for anything flying a trained policy it was a latch: one hit set it to 1.2 and
nothing ever took it back down. The item offered two homes and the wider one was
taken. `NpcShip.tickClocks(dt)` now runs the generator, the evasion decay and the
missile reload together, once a frame, before anything decides; `attack()` decays
nothing, `chooseWeapon` no longer takes a `dt` and has lost its "CALL IT ONCE PER
FRAME" warning along with the tick that earned it, and `Episode.step` pays one
debt where it used to pay two and miss a third. `missileReload` was the same bug
one class down and is fixed by the same line: it ticked inside `chooseWeapon`,
which `update()` reaches only down the `aggressiveToPlayer` branch, so a rack
froze mid-reload whenever the pirate was doing anything else and the two-second
gap between launches measured time spent hunting rather than time.

**The readout was the thing that lied, and it is now worth reading.** Over 200
held-out flight-probe episodes, the share of sampled frames the SPENT ITS TIME
column spent saying `evading` goes from **42.1% to 1.5%** for
`pirate-pack-r4-selectonly` and from **8.2% to 0.3%** for `pirate-attack-g3`; the
scripted control is unchanged, and the same figures at 40 episodes are 39.1% →
1.3% and 4.3% → 0.2%. The pack brain had been reporting itself as evading for two
fifths of every fight while actually being hit for a fiftieth of it, and the
column could only ever hold two values — `own policy` until the first hit,
`evading` for ever after.

**Nothing else moved, and that is measured rather than assumed.** `npm run
campaign` is identical to the last decimal, because the pirate a player meets is
scripted and its clock was already right. Six episode configurations at 40 seeds
and again at 200 — policy solo, pack, scripted solo, and scripted and policy
threes against an armed `jameson-defend-g2` — give **0 of 6 differing report
digests** at both sizes and the same 318 warheads over the 1,200 episodes, so
`EPISODE_SCHEMA` stays at **5**: no episode reads the flag on the path that
changed, because a policy pirate never enters `attack()` (that is **73**) and a
scripted one saw the same within-frame value either way. No encoder observes
`underFire`, so no brain was invalidated. The only episode figure that moves is
the latch itself — pirates ending a fight still flagged fall from 696 to 366 of
2,400. Where it does bite in the live sky is the ship the item named: the armed
trader on `jameson-defend-g2` reaches `brainFly` down the `fleeing` branch and
never calls `attack()`, and through the real `update()` its `underFire` read
1.200 at 0.6s, 1.2s, 5s and 10s after one ram where it now reads 0.600 and then
zero. A pirate hit at long range and left to amble was latched forever too, which
the item did not mention.

The tests are a new `test/ship-clocks.test.ts` — twenty assertions — rather than
more of `break-off.test.ts`, which the ceiling caught at 438 lines and which was
right to catch it: everything else in the suite tests a ship DOING something, and
this is the file for what is true of it while it does anything at all. It flies
both paths the way a frame flies them, then again through `NpcShip.update`, which
is where the bug lived. `npm test` goes **3,005 to 3,024 passed, 0 failed**.

Every rule it protects was broken and restored. Deleting the line that decays the
flag fails **11**: eight of the new ones, plus one in `defence-answer.test.ts`
and two in `selection.test.ts` that it reaches on its own, because a permanently
evasive scripted pirate flies a different fight. Deleting the reload line beside
it fails **6**, two here and four in `missile-cap.test.ts`. And the shape the bug
actually had — the clocks ticking inside the `aggressiveToPlayer` branch instead
of above it — fails **4**, all of them in the new file, which is the gate that
did not exist before. Re-measuring `missile-cap.test.ts`'s own mutations after
the reload tick left `chooseWeapon` is what corrected the figures in the 83
paragraph above.

One thing in the item is wrong: it expects `describeFlight` to have been reading
`evading` for the armed trader, and it never was, because `fleeing` outranks
`evading` in that function. The trader's damage was to the two rules that read
the flag on a handover, not to its readout.

**87 is done, and no line of `src/` moved.** Both rate-ramp checks compared a
wrapper with the `rampToward` call it expands to, so each was the same expression
on both sides of its `===`. They measure against the rule the exponential form
replaced now — `cur + (target - cur) * rate * dt` at 1/60, which is exactly what
4.1396, 13.3886 and 5.2207 were solved for, from 4, 12 and 5 per second — because
an expectation that comes from outside the implementation is the whole of the
difference. Moving `BRAIN_RATE_DECAY` to 5.3, which is the finding's headline and
the item's own verify, goes from **0 assertions failing to 1**; `BRAIN_RATE_RAMP`
+1% from **0 to 1**, and the commander's `RATE_DECAY` +1% from **0 to 1**. The
item's own worst case — a `rampToward` that returns its input unchanged — fails
**16**, five of them these. `npm test` goes **3,054 to 3,060 passed, 0 failed**.

**Half of that rule was already tested, in another file, and the first draft of
this work made it two homes.** `test/flight.test.ts` — whose header says the ramp
lives there because it is the piece that was wrong four times — already pinned
the hold at 60Hz against the same old linear rule, and already held the
frame-rate independence and the snap to zero. Adding those three to
`combat-model.test.ts` would have been one rule with two homes, introduced by the
item about assertions that do not work. The re-fit is ONE rule, so all four
constants sit together in the section about the ramp's four homes, and
flight.test.ts keeps the ramp's SHAPE, which is what its section is titled: the
same handling at 15, 30, 60 and 144Hz, and the tail that snaps to zero. The
commander's `RATE_RAMP` is the one constant the project could already see move,
and it still fails exactly one assertion — the same cover, in one place instead
of two.

**The third check could half-see, which the item did not notice.** `CC_MAX_PITCH
=== 0.5 * TURN.pitch` writes the `0.5` out a second time, so it does catch that
literal moving in `combat-computer.ts` — 1 assertion, now 2. What it cannot see
is the thing it says it tracks: moving the trader Cobra's roster row 1% went from
**0 failures to 1**. The row is found by design id now, so a reordered roster
fails as well, and 0.7 and 1.2 are written down because a cap that moves
invalidates every brain fitted at it. The second ramp check's real claim — that a
brain-flown ship and the combat computer ramp the same way — is a measurement
now: 120 steps of `brainFly` with the control pinned, held for a second and
released for a second, predicted step by step by `ccRamp`, worst error **0**.
Drifting `brainFly`'s decay to the commander's 13.3886 while `ccRamp` keeps
5.2207 fails it at a worst error of 0.368, and nothing else in the suite notices.

**The two smaller ones in the same family are done too.** `test/npc.test.ts`'s
invariant-15 check asserted `player.speed === 100` after 300 frames, which sees a
write to `speed` and nothing else — an NPC that nudged the commander's POSITION
every frame failed **0** assertions in the whole suite. The commander is frozen
now, the ref and the position and the quaternion, and a module is strict mode so
a write throws: the position nudge fails **2** and the speed one **2**. The trap
is asserted rather than trusted, and it runs inside the flight that was already
counting fire events, so one engagement says both halves of the claim. In
`test/brain-names.test.ts` the round-trip hatch exempted two ids where one needs
it — `pirate-attack-g3` round-trips perfectly well, so of five ids three were
tested. The exact SET of failures is named now: a colliding selection that stops
g3 reading back as itself goes from **5 failures to 6**, the sixth being the
round trip, which is the check that was supposed to notice. It fails the other
way as well — giving `jameson-defend-g2` a selection of its own, which is what
81 would do, fails 2 and asks for its exemption to be deleted.

**Nothing the player meets moved**: `npm run campaign` is identical to the last
decimal, `npm run elite-a` is 480 passed and `npm run portability` 0
contaminated. `test/combat-model.test.ts` is 412 lines and is listed in
`tools/sizes.mjs` with the reason — nine sections asking one question, and split
by subsystem each half stops being an answer to it.

**81, 82 and 84 are the same root**: `d563e3d` made the scripted attack run what
ships, and the surfaces that describe or measure the AI did not all follow.
`pirate-attack-g3`'s picker line still says "THE FIGHT THE GAME SHIPS" beside a
`scripted` line that says "WHAT SHIPS"; `npm run evaluate`'s flight table and
`npm run survivability`'s eight rows have no entry for the AI a player meets;
and the `scripted` line's own quoted figures do not reproduce (4.42 attack runs
measured against a claimed 5.2, and it is not the tactics vocabulary — forcing
every roll to `run` reads 4.33).

**86 is the one that needs a human.** Nothing about `jameson-defend-g2` has been
flown, and it is both the armed trader's brain and the combat computer the player
buys. It is stationary on nine frames out of ten — mean speed 10.6 out of 400 on
the commander's own hull — and no term in the selection can see that. The
measurements say it is excellent (0 deaths in 800, 41.6% of its attackers
destroyed, every warhead answered); CLAUDE.md says a policy that wins every
measurement can still be the wrong one, and this is exactly that case.

Progress: **1 / 1 complete**. The model is Chris's and is decided: S prompts
for a name and the same name overwrites, autosaves happen on their own and are
kept as a set, and you can load either. One question in the spec is a
game-design call rather than an implementation one — whether the death screen
may offer an autosave — and it is marked ask, do not decide silently.

## Review context

These four items came from a fresh read of the live worktree after TODO 16, not
from the stale `.architecture-review/analysis.json` generated against
`de9a668`. The old deterministic findings remain useful historical evidence,
but their `Game` and `NpcShip` surface counts do not describe current code.

Manual sound, Dodo-docking, and pasted browser-playtest checks still require a
browser and speakers; every item should record which of those was feasible.
