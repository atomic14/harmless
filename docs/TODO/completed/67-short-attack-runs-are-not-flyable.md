# 67 — Short attack runs are not flyable, so the rhythm is fixed at ~9s

> Completed plan. Archived from the active queue.

**Kind:** combat feel · **Severity:** medium · **Size:** medium
**Depends on:** none

## Why

Chris, having flown the attack run: *"I think one thing I'm observing they fly
quite far before turning for another run."* Measured over 40 five-ship
engagements, the gap between one ship's merges was **9.4s median**, and it went
out to 1,135 units in between.

The obvious fix does not work, and `break-off.ts` records why in its
`EXTEND_RANGE_MIN` comment. Lowering the turn-back range shortens the gap a
little and then breaks the run:

```
band        450-900   700-1100   750-1250   800-1400   900 fixed
rammed         22.7        4.4        8.8        3.7         2.9
passes/ep      4.77       5.30       4.98       4.63        5.25
median apex     906       1126       1236       1331        1134
```

Below about 700 the ship arrives at the merge still pointed at the middle and
flies into it. So the shipped band is 700-1100: it destaggers a gang, which was
the other half of what Chris asked for, and leaves the runs the same LENGTH as
before.

## Where the code is

- `src/game/break-off.ts` — the phase machine (`nextAttackPhase`), the band
  (`EXTEND_RANGE_MIN`/`MAX`, whose comment holds the table above), the miss
  distance and the throttle rule.
- `src/game/npc.ts` — `attack()`, which flies the three phases. The `extending`
  branch is the one that steers for nothing.
- `src/game/combat-sim-report.ts` — `PASS_CLOSE`/`PASS_FAR`, what counts as a
  pass, and a comment on why `PASS_FAR` must stay below the shortest run.

## What is actually failing

**The entire 180 happens in the closing leg.** `extending` flies dead straight —
it steers for nothing at all — so when the phase flips, the closing leg has to
contain both the turn-around AND the run-in that settles the ship onto its
`PASS_MISS_DISTANCE` line. Below ~700 units there is not room for both.

A pilot does not fly straight for 900 units and then pivot. They fly a curve,
arriving already pointed with the whole remaining distance available as run-in.

## What is NOT the problem

- **Not the turn rate.** Slowing does not raise it — `steerToward` rotates by
  `turnRate * dt` and speed appears nowhere in it. `closingThrottle` already
  exploits what slowing DOES buy (radius, and the rate you must track).
- **Not tuning.** Five bands were measured; the floor is structural.
- **Not steering at the target during the extend.** Tried, and it cancels the
  extend outright: 0.90 passes an episode with the range spread collapsed to
  274/366/709, which is the turret shape the whole cycle exists to avoid.

## What to work out

- **A turn that keeps an outward component.** The naive version steers at the
  target and the ship simply comes back. What is wanted is an arc — still
  opening the range while rotating — so the run-out and the turn overlap
  instead of being sequential.
- **Where the arc starts.** A `CLEAR_RANGE` constant was drafted (340, being
  `BREAK_OFF_RANGE` plus half again) on the reasoning that turning before the
  ship has cleared puts it back through the target it just passed. That number
  was never tested against a working arc.
- **What it does to the pass counter.** `PASS_FAR` must stay below the shortest
  run the model can produce or the measurement goes blind — see
  `combat-sim-report.ts`, which records that this was nearly got wrong once.

## Watch out for

- **Rams are the failure mode**, and they are the thing Chris complained about
  in the first place. Any candidate is judged on contact damage first and gap
  second.
- **`EXTEND_RANGE_MIN` can come down only when this is done.** The two are one
  change; lowering the band alone has already been measured and it does not
  work.

## Acceptance

- Median merge-to-merge gap materially under 9.4s at contact damage no worse
  than the shipped 4.4 an episode.
- The range spread does not collapse — a shorter cycle that stops sweeping is a
  turret with a faster clock.
- `EXTEND_RANGE_MIN` can be lowered, and the doc comment's table is re-derived.

## Verify

`npm run flight-probe` gives the one-on-one shape (passes, range spread, rams).
The GAP is a five-ship measurement and there is no tool for it; this is the
snippet the numbers above came from:

```js
// node --experimental-strip-types <this file>   — from the repo root
import * as THREE from 'three';
const { Episode } = await import('../src/ai-training/scenario.ts');
const { FIXED_DT } = await import('../src/game/world-step.ts');
const { BREAK_OFF_RANGE } = await import('../src/game/break-off.ts');
const gaps = [], apex = [];
for (let e = 0; e < 40; e++) {
  const ep = new Episode({ seed: 30000007 + e * 7919,
    pirates: Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => ({ kind: 'scripted' })),
    trader: { kind: 'holding' }, traderArmed: false,
    traderClass: 'playerCobra', maxTime: 70 });
  ep.setup();
  const gap = new THREE.Vector3();
  const last = new Map(), inside = new Map(), peak = new Map();
  let t = 0;
  while (!ep.done) {
    ep.step(FIXED_DT); t += FIXED_DT;
    ep.pirates.forEach((p, i) => {
      if (!p.alive) return;
      const d = gap.copy(ep.trader.pos).sub(p.pos).length();
      peak.set(i, Math.max(peak.get(i) ?? 0, d));
      const now = d < BREAK_OFF_RANGE;             // a MERGE
      if (now && !inside.get(i)) {
        if (last.has(i)) { gaps.push(t - last.get(i)); apex.push(peak.get(i)); }
        last.set(i, t); peak.set(i, 0);
      }
      inside.set(i, now);
    });
  }
}
const q = (a, f) => [...a].sort((x, y) => x - y)[Math.floor(a.length * f)];
console.log('seconds between merges', q(gaps, 0.1), q(gaps, 0.5), q(gaps, 0.9));
console.log('how far out in between ', q(apex, 0.1), q(apex, 0.5), q(apex, 0.9));
// shipped, as of 2026-08-03: 7.85 / 9.35 / 12.40s, apex 931 / 1125 / 1294
```

Then fly it. The gap is a feel question and 9.4s was reported by a human before
it was ever measured.
