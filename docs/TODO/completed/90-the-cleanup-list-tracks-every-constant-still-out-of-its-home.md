# 90 — The cleanup list tracks every constant still out of its home

> Completed plan. Archived from the active queue.

Stragglers from the constants move. Everything here is a loose end the slices
deliberately did not tie, recorded as it was found so none of it is discovered
again from scratch.

Three kinds, and they want different treatment:

- **Blocked** — will be resolved by a later slice. No decision needed, just
  order.
- **Decided** — a stated exception. Not pending work; do not "fix" it.
- **Open** — needs a decision or a separate behaviour change.

---

## Blocked — a later slice unblocks these

| what | where | unblocked by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WORLD_SPEED_PER_SOURCE_SPEED` = `PLAYER_FLIGHT.maxSpeed / playerHull(COBRA_MK_3_HULL_ID).maxSpeed` | `game/ship-specs.ts:107` | nothing scheduled — see below |
| `ANCHOR_RECHARGE_RATING` = `playerHull(COBRA_MK_3_HULL_ID).energyRechargeRating` | `game/systems.ts` | nothing scheduled — the same case, see below |
| `ANCHOR_NPC_MAX_ENERGY` = `recommendedNpcProfile(COBRA_MK_3_DESIGN).maxEnergy` | `game/npc-energy.ts` | nothing scheduled — the same case again, found by slice 7 |
| `COMMODITY_COUNT` = `COMMODITIES.length` | `galaxy/living.ts` | nothing scheduled — the same case, made a derivation by slice 8: the table it is the length of is DATA the home may not import |

All of these are correctly-derived constants that an import-nothing leaf cannot
reach. **This will keep happening**: the constants that most want to be
expressions are exactly the ones that pull another module's table into the leaf.
When a slice leaves one behind, add it here rather than weakening the leaf rule.

**The flight slice closed the other three.** `RAM_MIN_SPEED`, `CC_MAX_PITCH` and
`CC_MAX_ROLL` were waiting on `PLAYER_FLIGHT` and `TURN`; those are now
`constants/player-flight.ts` and `constants/hull-motion.ts`, and each derivation
lives in the constants file for its own subject — `RAM_MIN_SPEED` in
`constants/tactic-choice.ts`, the two caps in `constants/combat-computer.ts`.
They still evaluate to 280, 0.7 and 1.2. The same slice wrote the mirror of
`brain-flight.ts`'s `4.1396` warning beside `PLAYER_FLIGHT.rateRamp`, so the
pair now names itself from both sides.

**`WORLD_SPEED_PER_SOURCE_SPEED` is a harder case than the three above, and it
may never move.** Half of it is `PLAYER_FLIGHT`, which is home. The other half
is a released hull's top speed, and reaching one means `ship-identity.ts` →
`catalogue.ts` → six generated tables. The survey suggested relaxing the leaf
rule here on the grounds that "the catalogue is itself a leaf" — it is not; only
`combat-math.ts` imports nothing, and `playerHull` is nowhere near it. The
alternative, restating the Cobra's 42 as a literal, puts a pack number in a
Harmless file, which `ship-specs.ts`'s header forbids in capitals. So it stays
beside the roster, where both halves are already in scope, and the reasoning is
written out beside it. Anyone who wants it in the home has to answer the leaf
question first, for the whole directory.

**`FAME_FULL` — CLOSED by slice 8, exactly as scheduled.** It was the fourth
row of the table above: the rating ladder's Dangerous rung restated in
`game/threat.ts` because neither file had a home the other could read. The
ladder is `constants/rating.ts` now, so the restatement is an expression —
`constants/threat.ts` reads the rung out of `RATINGS` by name — and the
`test/economy.test.ts` bisect stays, because it is what goes red if either
CONSUMER re-inlines a literal. Slice 8 broke both directions to prove it: a
diverged `FAME_FULL = 2561` (1 failure) and a drifted `rating()` boundary (2).

**`ANCHOR_RECHARGE_RATING` is the second of exactly that shape, found by slice
4, and it is now the only constant left in `game/systems.ts`.** It is the Cobra
Mk III's `energyRechargeRating`, read from the catalogue so that a hull rated 2
recovers twice as fast whatever the Cobra's own rating becomes — the same
`playerHull` reach, the same six generated tables, the same refusal to restate a
pack number. The rest of the file's recharge model is `constants/recharge.ts`,
which says in its header that this half could not follow and why. Slice 3
predicted this would keep happening and it did, in the very next slice; the two
of them together are the argument that whoever reopens the leaf rule should
reopen it once, for the directory, rather than case by case.

**`ANCHOR_NPC_MAX_ENERGY` is the third, found where the first two predicted.**
The representative NPC's released bank, read off the catalogue through
`recommendedNpcProfile(COBRA_MK_3_DESIGN)` so a re-import that moves the
Cobra's bank moves the anchor. Same reach, same refusal to restate a pack
number; it stays in `game/npc-energy.ts` as a named entry on the gate's list,
beside the design ids it is read from.

---

## Decided — stated exceptions, leave them alone

**`MISSILE_HULL` stays in `game/ordnance.ts`.** It is a memoised
`requireShipDef` lookup, not a rule, and moving it would put a function call
inside the leaf. It sits in the gate's per-name allowlist under a heading saying
it is a decision rather than pending work.

**`NPC_HIT_FALLOFF` is `NPC_LASER_RANGE` — Chris resolved it, 2026-08-05.**
The history's doubt (the expression predates the gate matching the reach) is
kept beside the constant, and the first reading is now asserted: the falloff
IS the gun's reach, so a retuned reach moves the aim curve with it. Byte
identical at landing; the `/ 0.75` reading is recorded as the road not taken.

**`SIGHT_Y`'s CSS twin stays duplicated.** docs/TODO/93 owns the phosphor and
the stylesheets; CSS was ruled out of 90's scope.

**`VIEW_QUATS` stays in `game/views.ts`.** Four `THREE.Quaternion`s are objects
and the home may not import three, so the only part of the table that could move
is its four yaw angles — and splitting one table across two files buys nothing
here: the angles have no second home to diverge from, and 0/π/±π/2 is the
DEFINITION of front, rear, left and right rather than a number anybody would
tune. It has its own entry on the gate's list saying so. Slice 5 also found that
nothing tested it — left and right could be swapped with the suite still green —
and `test/world-step.test.ts` holds all four against the nose now.

**`ARENA_RADII = 16` stays a literal in `game/combat-sim-opening.ts`.** It is
the same number as `WITCHPOINT_RADII` and a DIFFERENT RULE: the witchpoint was
chosen for how big the planet looks and how long the cruise in takes, the arena
for its margins to the sun, the station and the ground across 768 systems.
Moving where a jump drops the player should not silently move where an exercise
is fought. Its old comment said it was not imported because game.ts cannot be
loaded without a browser; that reason expired in slice 5 and the honest one is
written there now.

**The step's docking-computer gains — CLOSED by slice 10, exactly as
scheduled.** `world-step.ts`'s `1.2 * dt` steer and `Math.min(1, dt * 1.5)`
throttle are `DC_TURN_RATE` and `DC_THROTTLE_GAIN` in
`constants/docking-computer.ts`, and `test/docking.test.ts` solves both back
out of one real `WorldStep` frame — so a re-inlined literal in the step goes
red even though `planDocking` never sees either.

**The station's Viper stack went to the SPAWNING slice, not the station's.**
`STATION_DEFENCE_MIN`, `_SPAN`, `_STANDOFF`, `_STACK` and `_JITTER` are in
`constants/spawn-placement.ts`, because `launchStationDefence` in `spawning.ts`
is the one function that spends all five and they are one rule — a short stack
along the slot normal. WHETHER the Vipers launch is `law.ts`'s `DEFENCE_RANGE`
and stays with the career slice. Splitting one small rule across two slices to
satisfy a file's title would have been the worse trade.

**`ship-roles.ts` and `role-variants.ts` keep everything, and it is decided.**
`BAND_SLOTS` is the released sets' own blueprint-slot numbering — DATA, and
deliberately PRIVATE, because the file's header argues that nothing outside it
should hold a copy of "17 to 24 means pirate". `ROLE_BANDS`, `CANDIDATES`,
`MISSION_TARGET_DESIGNS` and `COMBAT_ROLES` are all keyed on `NpcRole`, a type
declared in `ship-roles.ts` that the home may not import, and two of them are
catalogue lookups computed once at load — the same shape as `MISSILE_HULL`. Each
is a named entry on the gate's list with the reason.

### LEGACY AND MIGRATION WERE DELETED. Do not reinstate them.

Chris, 2026-08-04: *"We don't have any data to migrate yet — anything legacy can
be removed and any migration is not needed. We will only need migrations once we
start to release official versions."*

Slice 4 deleted, in `src/`:

| gone | what it was |
| --- | --- |
| `LEGACY_MAX_ENERGY`, `LEGACY_MAX_SHIELD` | the commander's pools before TODO 27 made them 255 points |
| `migratedSystems` | rescaling a save written on those |
| `LEGACY_ASTEROID_HULL_POINTS` | a rock's share of the pre-energy hull scale |
| `migratedNpcState` | rebuilding a bank from a save written on that |
| `legacyHullPoints` | the same scale as a roster column, on all 49 rows |

**The reasoning is docs/TODO/53's, and it is a rule rather than a one-off.** 53
deleted `migrateLegacySaves` and the TODO README records the argument: *"53
asked who the code was for. Nobody but us has ever played, so the answer was
nobody, and a careful migration serving nobody is still a hazard."* A migration
is a second reading of a value's meaning, kept alive for a reader who does not
exist, and it is exactly the second home this whole item is about.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **The survey's `LEGACY_MAX_ENERGY` / `ENERGY_BANKS` trap is resolved by
  subtraction.** It is listed under Coincidences as "historically the same fact,
  now permanently different, because a save on disk depends on one". No save on
  disk depends on one. There is a single 4 in the subject now, `ENERGY_BANKS`,
  and it is free to move; `pools.ts` records what the other one was so that a
  reappearing 4 is recognisable as a migration divisor coming back.
- **`ENERGY_REGEN_FRACTION` and `SHIELD_REGEN_FRACTION` had to stop being
  derivations.** They were `0.1 / LEGACY_MAX_ENERGY` and
  `0.035 / LEGACY_MAX_SHIELD`. They are literals in `constants/recharge.ts` now,
  0.025 and 0.035, with the pre-TODO-27 arithmetic written out beside them —
  identical to the bit, and honest, because a fraction of a pool per second is
  what they are on any scale.

`test/damage-paths.test.ts`'s `GONE` list holds all six names against
`game/systems.ts`, `game/npc-energy.ts`, `game/ship-specs.ts`, `game/world.ts`
and `game/persistence.ts`, so reinstating any of them fails the build. Break it
by putting one back; that is what the check is for.

### THE IDENTITY FALLBACKS WENT TOO. Do not reinstate them either.

Slice 4 kept three of these on the grounds that they were corruption tolerance
as well as history, and left the decision to the saves slice. **Chris overruled
that on 2026-08-04:** *"yes, lose them — we don't need them. An unreadable save
is just old junk at the moment."* So the answer to "what does an unreadable save
do" is: it is not a save. Deleted:

| gone | what it was | what happens now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `migratedPlayerHullId` (`ship-identity.ts`) | a missing OR unresolvable `shipId` became the Cobra Mk III, on every load from `storage.ts` and `persistence.ts` | `requirePlayerHullId` at both of those boundaries |
| `savedShipIdentity` returning `undefined` for `{}` | a snapshot with no ids took its design's recommended variant | it throws; `NpcSnapshot.designId` and `.profileId` are REQUIRED |

**The refusal is the save system's existing one, not a new failure mode.** That
was the open question and it is answered by matching what `parseSaveId` and a
bad `v` already do:

- `repairCommander`'s throw happens inside `readSave`'s `try`, so a record whose
  commander names no hull **reads as null** — the same nothing an unparseable
  key reads as. `bootSave()` then finds no save and `bootCommander()` starts a
  fresh one. Nothing reaches the screen.
- `savedShipIdentity`'s throw comes out of `World.restoreNpcs`, inside
  `Persistence.restore`, which `Persistence.resume` already catches: *"a world
  that will not come back must never cost you the commander"*. Every load in the
  UI is `setBootId` plus `location.reload()`, so `resume` is the only path a
  player can take into a restore. `test/world-step.test.ts` flies it and asserts
  `resume()` returns false rather than throwing, with the same bytes WITH their
  ids as the control.

**`role-variants.ts` was the third name on the list and it is LOAD-BEARING —
keep it.** Reading it, the only legacy thing in the file was the prose. Its
`recommendedProfileIdFor` fallbacks are live rules: a trader, a rock or an
overlay is not choosing a build for its gun, and the Constrictor sits in a slot
no pirate band draws from. `roleCombatProfileId` is called once per roster row
by `ship-specs.ts` at load and by nothing else now — a restore reads the build
out of the snapshot. Only the header and one docstring changed.

**A fourth thing was found and also kept**, for a reason that is not the one
written beside it. `persistence.ts`'s `specForDesign(...) ?? pirateSpecForTier(...)`
said the tier was "the answer for a save written before ships had ids, which
carries no design to look up". Every snapshot carries a design now, so that
sentence is dead — but the lookup can still miss, because a design the roster no
longer flies in that role has no row, and rosters do move (the Asp Mk II came
off the pirate list on purpose). `test/ship-roles.test.ts` tests that case now
instead of the legacy one.

Both harnesses were grepped for every name touched — `migratedPlayerHullId`,
`savedShipIdentity`, `specForDesign`, `designId`, `profileId`, `shipId` — and
neither names any of them. `test/playtest.js` and `train/jameson-autopilot.js`
take `useHarnessSaves`, `clearHarnessSaves` and `saveNamespace` from
`storage.ts` and nothing else, and all three are still exported.

### AND THE FOUR THAT WERE LEFT AS SEPARATE DECISIONS. All gone, plus a fifth.

The identity slice found four more legacy tolerances on its way through and
left each one as its own decision rather than folding them into that commit.
**Chris decided all four on 2026-08-04:** *"yes, clear them now."*

| gone | where | what it was |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CanisterSnapshot.energy?` | `snapshot.ts`, `cargo.ts` | optional, and absence meant "whole" — a world written before canisters had a bank. Required now, like every other field of that snapshot, and `Cargo.restore` takes the number instead of defaulting it |
| the missing-`dockPlan` case | `test/snapshot.test.ts` | **there was no code**: `restoreState` walks the keys the snapshot HAS, so a save written before the docking latch was persisted kept the fresh `gate` default for free. The tolerance existed only as an assertion pinning the shape of that loop as though it were a rule about old worlds. docs/TODO/17's *"Old snapshots must still load"* is the acceptance it came from, and that line is superseded |
| the `career` note | `snapshot.ts` | *"Saves written before TODO 43 still carry the key; nothing reads it."* There is no such FIELD — 43 deleted it — and no such save. The rule above it (a world has no opinion about whose autosave group it is in) stays, and `test/career-identity.test.ts` section 4 still enforces it from the source |
| the bare-commander import | `screens/save-transfer.ts` | `readSaveFile` accepted a raw `CommanderData` — credits and a system index, no name, no version, no world — as an export from before saves were records |
| **`AutopilotState.control.ecm?`** | `combat-computer.ts` | **the fifth, found by the sweep.** Same shape as the canister's bank: optional so a save written before the E.C.M. head existed could restore a control without one. `act()` returns `Control.ecm` unconditionally (always false for a brain with no logit for it), so nothing this build can write omits it |

**The import needed no fourth refusal line.** That was the open question, because
this one is different in kind: the other four are about what our own format
tolerates, and this is about what an import accepts from a file a human pastes
in — so the failure mode is a person seeing an error rather than a save quietly
not loading. It reuses `NOT_A_SAVE`, which is what such a file IS: bytes with no
name, no version and no world are not a save file, and `WRONG_VERSION` would be
a lie about a shape that carries no `v` to be wrong. `NOT_A_SAVE`,
`WRONG_VERSION` and `STORE_FULL` are still the whole vocabulary.

### THREE THINGS LOOKED LEGACY AND WERE LIVE. Keep them; only the prose moved.

This keeps happening — it happened to the tier fallback last time — so it is
worth naming the tell. **A save migration and an IMPORT REPAIR are the same code
wearing different reasons**, and only one of them is dead.

- **`repairCommander` (`storage.ts`) is the import boundary's validator, not a
  migration.** Nothing this build writes needs repairing: `capture()` clones a
  whole `CommanderData`. What arrives incomplete is an imported FILE —
  `adoptSaveFile` takes the commander straight out of a stranger's JSON and
  writes it unexamined, so the next `readSave` is the first look anything gives
  it. A hand-edited ten-entry `cargo`, an `equipment` of `{}` or a `day` of
  `"soon"` reaches that function. Every guard stays; the docstring says what
  they are really for.
- **`LivingGalaxy.load` (`galaxy/living.ts`) defaults all five fields for the
  same reason** — `WorldSnapshot.galaxyState` is `unknown` and comes off the
  same file. Only `heat` carried a comment blaming saves written before
  notoriety existed; it was the odd one out and the reason was false. The
  comment went, the uniform defaulting stayed, and the function now says why.
- **`SaveRecord.commander` is still reachable** and was checked before the
  import branch went, because that branch looked like its only producer. It is
  not: a record naming a commander with a world that does not own one still
  lands commander-only, which is a shape a text editor can produce and no save
  of ours can.

**And a migration was found that never ran.** `repairCommander`'s
*"saves from before weighted ratings: every past kill counts as one"* cannot
fire: `newCommander()` gained `combatScore: 0` in the same commit that added the
guard (`04561f0`), above a `{ ...newCommander(), ...stored }` that had already
answered — so every career saved before weighted ratings came back UNRATED
rather than re-scored, from the day the feature shipped. Kept for what it can
still do (repair a spoiled score from the body count beside it) with the
comment corrected. **A second home does not have to disagree loudly to be a
defect; this one lost silently for a week.**

Three more stale claims from the identity slice were corrected in passing:
`CommanderData.shipId` still said a save without one *"migrates to the Cobra
Mk III"*, and `combatScore` and `furthestWave` still advertised what a save
written before them loads as. And `summariseSave`'s `c.combatScore ?? c.kills`
went: it is a SECOND HOME for a rule `repairCommander` owns, on a commander that
has already been through it — `saveRows` over `listSaves()` is its only caller.

Two `?? 0` reads of required `CommanderData` fields are still out there and were
deliberately not touched, because they are a different subject from saves:
`cargoTonnes`'s `c.survivors ?? 0` and `recordFurthestWave`'s
`c.furthestWave ?? 0` (`commander.ts`). Both are dead by the type. Whoever does
a general defensive-`??` pass owns them.

**Three assertions went and six replaced them, and all three were legacy.**
`an old NPC snapshot without a dock plan starts at the fresh gate default`
(the whole of the dockPlan tolerance), and `a pre-record export still imports`
with `...keeping its commander` (the bare-commander import). The import's three
replacements assert the refusal, the line the player is told, and that nothing
of the file reaches the shelf. The other three are new coverage: **a canister's
bank had none.** The fallback was indistinguishable from the truth until
something was wounded, and nothing ever wounded one — so a save that dropped the
bank would have looked right for ever. It round-trips a canister at 3 points
now, with a full capsule beside it as the control.

Both harnesses were grepped again, for `energy`, `dockPlan`, `restoreState`,
`serialiseState`, `career`, `readSaveFile`, `adoptSaveFile`, `commanderOf`,
`DEFAULT_NAME`, `canisterMaxEnergy`, `CanisterSnapshot`, `repairCommander`,
`combatScore`, `furthestWave` and `survivors`. Neither harness names any of them
in a load-bearing way: their `energy` hits are the defence encoder's own field
and `poolsLeft`/`energyLeft` from the kit, and their `career` hits are prose.

3073 passed, 0 failed. elite-a 483. portability 0 contaminated. Campaign
byte-identical on all 33 balance rows. Constants gate unmoved at 98/347 across
89 files. Every new gate was broken and confirmed red — the two required fields
fail `tsc` when made optional again, the canister round trip fails when
`Cargo.restore` defaults the bank, and all three import checks fail when the
bare-commander branch is put back.

---

## Open — a decision or a separate change

### Three derivations whose arithmetic no longer produces the shipped value — DECIDED 2026-08-05

**Chris kept all three shipped values**: the flown value is the rule and the
prose arithmetic was the approximation, recorded beside each constant. Not
pending work. The table stays as the record of what was asked:

| constant | shipped | its own stated arithmetic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tactics.slash.missDistance` | 175 | "1.6× the standard pass" = `110 × 1.6` = **176** |
| `CLEAR_RANGE` | 340 | `BREAK_OFF_RANGE` "and half again" = `220 × 1.5` = **330** |
| `CC_ACCEL` | 100 | the trader Cobra's `220 × ACCEL_FRACTION` = **101.2** |

Each would have been a real change to how a ship flies; none was worth
un-flying the values the game shipped and was tuned at.

### The six transcribed-number comments are ALL resolved

The survey listed six places where reasoning cites another file's value by
writing the number out: `save-file.ts:36`, `input.ts:53`, `player.ts:52-56`,
`docking.ts:11`, `jettison.ts:29`, `starfield.ts:48`. **Slice 3 did
`player.ts`'s, slice 5 did `input.ts`'s and `starfield.ts`'s, and slice 8 did
`jettison.ts`'s** — the strong way: the comment claimed `markOf` "uses the
same multiplier" while threat.ts wrote `* 4` as a bare literal, and both now
import `VALUE_PER_TONNE` from `constants/jettison.ts`, with
`test/economy.test.ts` solving the multiplier back out of the real `markOf`.
**Slice 10 did `docking.ts`'s** — the header's "spinning at 0.26 rad/s" names
`STATION_SPIN` now, and the rate is solved back out of the real scene in
`test/world.test.ts`. **And slice 11 did the last, `save-file.ts`'s**, the
strong way: `FLIGHT_RING` and `AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL` live in one file, the
"last minute of flying" comment names the cadence instead of writing 20, and
`test/saves.test.ts` pins the product at 60 seconds.

`starfield.ts` is the one worth copying: its two fade thresholds were justified
by "max ship speed is 400" and "8 x 400 = 3200", two numbers the file could not
see, and both are expressions over `PLAYER_FLIGHT.maxSpeed` and
`TORUS_MULTIPLIER` now — 520 and 2400 to the bit. A prose figure became a
derivation, which is stronger than a corrected sentence.

**The flight slice did `player.ts`'s, and found it already wrong.** The
commander's pitch cap was argued against four pirate hulls by transcribing
`turnRate × TURN.pitch` for each, and one of the four was an Asp Mk II at 1.68 —
a hull that has since been taken off the pirate roster on purpose. The comment
was reasoning about a ship the player cannot meet. It is now re-derived from the
rows it names in `test/combat-model.test.ts`, and the checks assert the claim
(you out-turn the heavy hulls, the light ones still edge you) rather than the
arithmetic.

That is the shape to copy for the other five: bringing both anchors into
`src/constants/` is what makes the reference expressible, and a check that
re-derives the product is what stops the next one rotting. **Expect at least one
of the remaining five to be wrong already.**

**A seventh that was not on the survey's list, found and fixed by slice 6.**
`test/combat-sim-opening.test.ts` held `NEAR`, `FAR`, `CONE_MIN` and `CONE_MAX`
— the spawner's own scatter bands, transcribed out of the function the file
exists to check — so a change to the scatter would have left every bound in that
file asserting the old band and passing. They are
`constants/opposition-ring.ts`'s now, and `OPPOSITION_RING_FAR` and
`OPPOSITION_CONE_FAR` are DERIVED from their near-and-span pairs rather than
written out, because `0.55 + 0.9` is 1.4500000000000002 in binary floating point
and the rounded figure would have been off by the wrong sign. `test/arena.test.ts`
had a round `Math.cos(1.0)` where it meant the cone the spawner promises, and
reads `OPPOSITION_CONE * OPPOSITION_CONE_FAR` now.

### `PRIZE_SATURATION` — DECIDED 2026-08-05: 2,500 Cr stands

Chris confirmed the shipped value over the prose's 1,600 Cr; the campaign's 33
rows are tuned against it and the old comment was the approximation. The
history below stays as the record of the survey's strongest finding.

The survey's strongest finding, moved to `constants/threat.ts` by slice 7 with
the value untouched and both readings written beside it. The constant is
25,000 tenths — 2,500 Cr — and the comment it carried for its whole life said
"1,600 Cr", with its swept comparison ("1,200 Cr → 9% gangs but median net
worth 2,242 Cr against 3,661") also written against the 1,600 reading. Either
the constant moved from 16,000 and the prose never followed, or the prose was
wrong when written; the history does not say which. 25,000 is what shipped and
what `npm run campaign`'s 33 rows are tuned against. Choosing the other
reading moves how often every wealthy commander meets a gang, so **it is a
balance decision for Chris with a campaign run attached, not a refactor.**

### The game floors a brain's target-speed input and the trainer does not

The training partition's biggest divergence, recorded beside
`TARGET_SPEED_FLOOR` when slice 7 moved it to `constants/brain-flight.ts`. The
game hands every attack policy `max(150, actual)` (brains.ts `targetSpeed`);
`ai-training/scenario.ts` hands its pirates the trader's raw speed, so against
a slow or braking target a training pirate reads observation slot 10 anywhere
down to 0.0 where the same brain in the game never reads below 0.375. Two of
the four target speeds `flies()` samples are unreachable in the live game.

Two readings survive: the floor is a real game rule the trainer must apply —
in which case every pirate brain was fitted in a world that does not exist
below 150 — or it is a patch for the brain being out of distribution at low
speed, and brains.ts already names the honest fix ("deleting the input
entirely... costs a retrain of every brain"). **Either way it is a behaviour
change with a training run attached — a decision, not a lookup.**

### The bulletin board reaches 68 tenths and everything else says 70 — DECIDED 2026-08-05: the tank is the rule

`CONTRACT_RANGE = MAX_FUEL` now, an expression at last; the 86 galaxy-1
pairs in (68, 70] became offerable. The campaign's balance rows all still
pass, and the trade decisions moved as widening the board must: median net
worth 7577.4 → 7320.9 Cr, cash in hand 764.1 → 420.4, first upgrade leg 6 →
9, best career 15085 → 18523 Cr — more work on offer means more taken, and
more of the worth held as cargo mid-run. The finding as it stood:

The survey's "reachable on a full tank is 68, 70 and 70", named by slice 8:
`CONTRACT_RANGE = 68` (constants/contracts.ts) against `MAX_FUEL = 70`, which
the tank enforces and which the living galaxy's convoy range now reads
directly. Nothing records whether the board's two-tenths margin is deliberate
(a job you can only just reach is a job one mis-jump fails) or a
transcription that predates the tank. Correcting it to `MAX_FUEL` widens the
bulletin board in every system — measured, galaxy 1 alone holds 86 ordered
pairs in (68, 70] that would become offerable — so **it is a decision with a
campaign run attached, not a refactor.** `test/contracts.test.ts` pins the
shipped 68 from both sides until it is taken.

### A wreck spills the ordinary goods plus Furs — DECIDED 2026-08-05: collapsed

Chris chose one rule: `WRECK_CARGO` is deleted and `Combat.wreck` spills
`ORDINARY_GOODS` — wrecks stop dropping Furs, and the three lists the survey
found are finally one class. The finding as it stood:

The ordinary-goods unification (slice 8, `constants/commodities.ts`) found
the three lists are TWO rules: the contract consignment and the generation
ship's shed cargo are one six-row class, and `WRECK_CARGO` is that class plus
Furs. Whether the seventh row is a flavour choice (furs read well as loot) or
a drift nobody noticed is recorded beside the constants;
`test/combat.test.ts` holds the relationship at exactly plus-Furs. Collapsing
the two lists — either way — moves what every wreck in the game drops, so it
is a decision, not a refactor.

### The thargon timer is 5 in one file and 4 in another — DECIDED 2026-08-05: one timer

Chris unified on 5: `THARGON_AMBUSH_DELAY` is deleted, `game.ts` reads
`THARGON_REDEPLOY`, and every mis-jump's first drone comes one second later
than it used to. The finding as it stood:

`constants/encounters.ts`'s `THARGON_REDEPLOY` is 5 and `THARGON_AMBUSH_DELAY`
is 4, and the second exists only because `game.ts`'s `enterWitchspace` sets the
same field to 4 while `encounters.ts` sets it to 5 everywhere else. The survey
found the pair; slice 6 named both and put them adjacent with the argument
written out, and deliberately did not choose.

Two readings survive. Either a mis-jump ambush is meant to open harder than an
ordinary Thargoid encounter — in which case the two constants stay and the
difference gets a sentence saying so — or somebody wrote 4 where they meant 5,
in which case `THARGON_AMBUSH_DELAY` is deleted and `game.ts` reads the
redeploy. **It costs a second of the opening of every mis-jump either way**, so
it is a decision rather than a refactor.

### NPCs fly through the Dodo's hull — FIXED 2026-08-05, both cubes read 50

The survey's live divergence, named by slice 10 and resolved by Chris:
`NPC_HULL_BOX_MARGIN = HULL_BOX_MARGIN` now, one rule at the only measured
value. The Dodo's cube face moved 236 → 246 (its tallest vertices are 243,
now covered) and the Coriolis's 200 → 210; NPC traffic near a Dodo bounces
where it silently clipped. `test/docking.test.ts`'s bisect follows the
constant and the campaign is unmoved — its trade legs never fly the sky.

### "Just outside the slot" is 420, 450 and 900 — DECIDED 2026-08-05

The bounce's 420 is MENACE, kept: a failed docking dumps you close to the
thing you just hit. Recorded beside the trio in `constants/station.ts`; not
pending work. The finding as it stood:

Named by slice 10 and kept adjacent in `constants/station.ts`:
`BOUNCE_STANDOFF = 420` (a fluffed docking), `LAUNCH_STANDOFF = 450` (the
bay), `DOCKED_BACKDROP_DISTANCE = 900` (where the docked menu parks you, whose
old comment claimed to be the launch point). Three different events, so three
constants — but the ORDER of the first two is the open question: the bounce
leaves you nearer the hull than the bay ever does, and nothing says whether
that is deliberate menace or drift. Choosing moves where every failed docking
puts the player, so the values stand until Chris picks a reading.

### The station's Vipers can launch inside each other — DECIDED 2026-08-05: left alone

Never observed in play, both ships move within a frame of launching, and any
fix moves every seeded Viper launch. The docstring already tells the truth
about the geometry. The measurement stays below for whoever revisits it:

`spawnPlacement`'s stack is 120 units along the slot normal with an 80-unit
jitter in an INDEPENDENT direction per ship, so a pair separated by 120 can end
up anywhere from 0 to 280 apart. Measured: 1.16% of pairs intersect in a
million-pair simulation, and the closest of 400 real seeded launches through
`launchStationDefence` was 27 units against a Viper's 18.75 contact radius.
`spawning.ts`'s docstring claimed they were "stacked so they do not arrive on
top of each other"; the prose is corrected and `test/spawning.test.ts` says what
is actually true.

Fixing it — a smaller jitter, a bigger stack, or a jitter taken perpendicular to
the normal — moves where every station-launched Viper in the game appears. It has
presumably never been noticed because both ships are moving within a frame of
launching, so this is a "is it worth changing" question rather than a bug report.

### CLAUDE.md carries the instruction — CLOSED by slice 14

The read-it-do-not-grep-it wording is in CLAUDE.md's "How we work" section,
beside the one-home rule it serves, with the reason attached. It waited for
the last slice exactly as planned: pointing an agent at a half-built home
would have been worse than pointing it nowhere.

### What slice 5 left inline in the world step, and for whom

The world clock slice named every inline number in `world-step.ts` that was its
own subject and left the rest where the SLICE THAT OWNS THE SUBJECT will find
it. None of these is visible to the gate — it reads column-zero declarations,
and every one of these is a literal in the middle of a function.

| left inline | where | whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npcTargetTimer = 2` — how often the sky re-decides who is hunting whom | `world-step.ts` | the rest of the fight; `npc-targeting.ts` owns the rule and has no constants file yet |
| ~~`stationDockZ + 40` — the NPC bounding cube~~ | `world-step.ts` | **taken by slice 10**: it is `NPC_HULL_BOX_MARGIN` in `constants/docking.ts`, and the divergence it names has its own Open entry below |
| the hermit's 900 / 320 / speed 40, and the generation ship's 6,000 | `world-step.ts` | encounters. **And the hermit's message says "SLOW TO 20" while the gate is `speed < 40`** — either the line is stale or the tolerance is deliberate, and nothing says which |
| ~~`strandedHintTimer = 8`~~ | `world-step.ts` | **taken by slice 11**: `STRANDED_HINT_FIRST`/`STRANDED_HINT_REPEAT` in `constants/witchspace.ts` — two rules, not a divergence, and the why is written beside them |
| `energyLowTimer = 1.2` and every message duration | `world-step.ts` | nobody: these are how long a line stays on the console, and the console's own slice can decide whether they are rules |

**Slice 6 took two of these.** The pirate wave's `9000 + random() * 4000` is
`PIRATE_WAVE_RANGE`/`_SPAN` and the drone's `multiplyScalar(150)` is
`THARGON_DEPLOY_RANGE`, both in `constants/spawn-placement.ts`. The 9,000 stayed
a LITERAL rather than becoming `PLAYER_INTEREST_RANGE`, for the reason recorded
above: "almost certainly the same rule" is not an argument for making two
numbers impossible to separate, and the argument is written beside the constant.

### What slice 6 left inline, and for whom

| left inline | where | whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 12]` — what a generation ship sheds, and `3 + randomInt(4)` of it | `spawning.ts` | the career. The survey's "ordinary goods" list has three homes — this one, `contracts.ts:56`, and `combat.ts:41` with Furs added — and the slice that owns the commodity table should unify them |
| `rng() < 0.5 ? 2 : 1` — traders when the living galaxy has no convoy due | `population.ts` | nobody: the tie-break inside one expression whose real rule is `MIN_TRADERS`/`MAX_TRADERS` |
| `policeFor`'s `>= 2` and `>= 1` | `population.ts` | nobody: the two branches of a two-line ladder. Note that its line between government 0 and 1 is a STEP APART from `ANARCHY_GOVERNMENT`'s, deliberately — a feudal system has exactly one patrol and pairs of pirates, which is what makes it the most dangerous place that still has a police force |
| `scatter(1)` in the hermit's placement | `spawning.ts` | nobody, and it is **a no-op that costs an rng draw**: `scatter(HERMIT_SCATTER).addScaledVector(scatter(1), 2)` adds a vector of magnitude 1 to 3 units to one of 7,000 to 21,000. Deleting it would change every seeded sky after it, so it is not a tidy-up |
| `d < 7000` — how far an NPC chases another NPC before losing interest | `npc.ts:680` | the rest of the fight. It is one rung above every constant in `hunt-ranges.ts` (6,000/6,500/6,000) and the same number as `AMBUSH_STANDOFF`, which is a different rule. Nothing names it and nothing tests it |

### What slice 7 left behind, and for whom

**Slice 8 took the career's four rows of this table**: `WRECK_CARGO` and
`ORE` are `constants/commodities.ts` (with the ordinary-goods decision
written down and the plus-Furs divergence in Open above), and `markOf`'s
capacity restatement and `* 4` multiplier are expressions over
`constants/commander.ts` and `constants/jettison.ts`, each pinned in the
measured shape by `test/economy.test.ts`.

| left | where | whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BEAM_FLASH = 0.12` — how long the cockpit beams stay lit | `combat.ts` | the console: it is a drawing duration under the item's own test, read by two orchestrators; the console slice can overrule that reading |
| the government scale top, `7 - sys.government` | `threat.ts` | the galaxy: the survey counts six homes for the 7, which is `GOVERNMENT_NAMES.length - 1` |
| `pirateThreat`'s ~18 formula weights (0.05, 0.25, 0.7, 0.6, 1.5, 1.2, 0.28, 0.5, 0.4...) | `threat.ts` | nobody: the shape of one function, out of scope by the item's own local-to-one-function rule, and `npm run campaign` pins them in aggregate |

### What slice 8 left inline, and for whom

| left inline | where | whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `3 + randomInt(4)` — how many canisters a generation ship sheds | `spawning.ts` | encounters/spawning: a spawn's own draw; the LIST it draws from moved to `constants/commodities.ts` |
| `generateContractOffers`' reward formula (~15 numbers: counts 2+3, rolls 0.55/0.8, rates 22/1.6/90, 240/6.0, 170/4, deadlines 4/12, 3/16, 6/10) | `contracts.ts` | nobody: the shape of one function, and `npm run campaign` pins the whole board in aggregate |
| `advance`'s per-event deltas (arrival/loss pressure 0.05/0.03/0.08, danger hits 0.22/0.08, departure rate /60000, tonnes 5+25, risk 0.035/0.2 cap 0.5, the 400-convoy cap, the ±0.25 price clamp, headline thresholds) | `galaxy/living.ts` | nobody: the shape of the step, pinned in aggregate by the campaign and statistically by `test/galaxy.test.ts`; the three DECAYS moved because they are the rates the whole memory runs on |
| `killValue`'s 5/2/1 weighting | `commander.ts` | nobody: a two-branch ladder inside one function, asserted by `test/economy.test.ts` |
| `newCommander`'s starting loadout (missiles 3, Lave 7, galaxy 1, mission stage 0) | `commander.ts` | nobody: the function IS the definition of a fresh commander; the two figures with prose homes (the grubstake, the tank) are constants the briefing now interpolates |
| the mission's stage numbers 0-4 | `missions.ts` | nobody: the machine's own states, documented on `MissionState`; `constants/jump.ts`'s plans-leg mis-jump chance names stage 3 in prose only |
| `20 - this.cargoTonnes()` — the harness's copy of the small hold | `train/jameson-autopilot.js` | the harnesses are not on any gate (see below); it could read `cargoCapacity` off the module it already imports, and should the day anything makes it buy a bay |

One survey doubt was settled by measurement rather than moved:
`HARMLESS_POLICY`'s rock-hermit bank says "240 is what a Coriolis carries" and
the survey suspected the figure was really the Dodo's. Both released stations
carry 240 (read from the catalogue, 2026-08-04), so the prose is true of the
Coriolis — and of the Dodo — and nothing needed changing.

### What slice 9 left behind, and for whom

`game/screens/chart.ts:158` still writes `target.width / 256` as a bare
literal — the same span as the encyclopaedia's new `CHART_SPAN_X`
(`constants/chart-metric.ts`), unnamed in the console's own short-range
chart. It is the console slice's file (`ui/screens.ts`'s group), not the
galaxy's, so it was left rather than moved; when that slice lands it can read
`CHART_SPAN_X` instead of the digit.

### What slice 10 left behind, and for whom

| left | where | whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planDocking`'s approach-speed shape — the 110 run-in cap, the 0.7/0.55 throttle fractions, the 0.45 slope, the 25 floor, and the 1.5/0.95/1.15/2 phase factors | `game/docking.ts` | nobody: the shape of one function, out of scope by the item's own local-to-one-function rule; the two anchors it turns on (`GATE_HALF_WIDTHS`, `LINED_UP_LATERAL`) are the constants and both are pinned |
| the hermit's trade range at 900 | `world-step.ts` | encounters (already in slice 5's table). The same number as `DOCKED_BACKDROP_DISTANCE` and a different rule — how near a rock offers trade has nothing to do with where a menu parks a ship |
| `spawnPosition`, the field name | `world/system-scene.ts`, `world.ts` | nobody, unless it grates: the value is the docked BACKDROP and the comments now say so, but the name still suggests spawning. Renaming is an API touch across four files for no behaviour |

### The README is a prose home for the torus multiplier

`README.md`'s key table says "torus jump drive (8×, stars streak; cuts out when
mass-locked)". Slice 5 made the manual's caption and the briefing read
`TORUS_MULTIPLIER`, and markdown cannot import. `test/key-help.test.ts` holds
the README to the binding table by KEY only, never by description, so this one
is checked by nothing. It belongs with the non-TypeScript homes below.

### `CARRY_LIMIT` is still module-private in `engine/input.ts`

Three unread taps of one key, chosen against `MAX_STEPS_PER_FRAME`. Slice 5 put
the budget in the home and the comment names it now instead of writing "is 5",
but the constant itself waits for the console slice — and when it lands, the
relationship wants a check rather than a sentence, in the shape
`test/combat-model.test.ts` uses for the rate ramps.

### The scan cannot see four things — and had a fifth hole, now closed

Recorded so nobody assumes the gate is total. **The leaf check missed
side-effect imports.** It scanned for `from '...'`, so `import '../game/rng.ts';`
— no binding, no `from` — went straight through, and slice 6 found it by adding
one to `constants/jump.ts` and watching the check stay green. That is the more
dangerous of the two shapes, because it pulls a module's top-level work into the
leaf while leaving nothing in the file for a reader to notice. It matches both
patterns now, and both were confirmed red. The remaining four:

- **Function-local constants.** The scan is column-zero only, by the item's own
  rule that a value whose meaning is local to one function is not in scope.
- **Magic numbers written inline.** The survey found hundreds — `threat.ts`
  alone has ~18 unnamed tuning values that `npm run campaign` is tuned against.
  A named constant in the wrong place is caught; an unnamed one anywhere is not.
- **`train/` and `tools/`.** Excluded deliberately: the trainer's search
  hyperparameters and seed bases are its own, and `tools/` is a separate world.
  But `train/` also mirrors game constants, and those mirrors are exactly what
  invariant 15 keeps being broken by — see the survey's training section.
- **Non-TypeScript homes.** CSS and the four `.html` files. 93 owns the first;
  nothing owns the second.

### The two browser-console harnesses are not on any gate

`test/playtest.js` and `train/jameson-autopilot.js` reach into `src/` with
DYNAMIC imports against the dev server, which is the whole point of them: the
commodity table, the contraband list and the autopilot's turn rates stop being
copies kept in step by hope. Nothing type-checks them and nothing runs them, and
a module namespace object has no missing-property error, so a name that moves
becomes `undefined` in silence.

**It has already happened.** Slice 2 moved `CC_MAX_SPEED` and `CC_ACCEL` out of
`game/combat-computer.ts`, and `jameson-autopilot.js:43` went on destructuring
them from it — so the harness spent the interval throttling the player to
`Math.min(undefined, …)`, which is `NaN`. The flight slice found it and fixed
both files.

Until something checks them, **every slice must grep these two files for the
names it moves.** That is the one place in this project where grep is the right
tool, because the hazard is a name that is not there.

Slice 4 did it, for all eighteen names it moved or deleted, and both files were
clean: neither harness names a pool constant, a sun distance, a recharge rate or
any of the deleted legacy names. They reach `poolsLeft` and `energyLeft` through
the kit, and both of those are still exported from `game/systems.ts`.

Slice 6 did it for all thirty-eight names it moved or created plus the eight
functions whose exports changed shape, and both files were clean of every one.
Neither harness names a scatter, a population chance, an encounter clock or any
spawner function; `spawning.ts`, `population.ts`, `encounters.ts` and `world.ts`
are not reached from either of them at all.

Slice 7 did it for all thirty-one names it moved, created or left behind as
named entries, plus the threat and brain functions whose files changed
(`pirateThreat`, `markOf`, `memberTier`, `tierForScore`, `hullThreatTier`,
`sourceThreatScore`, `pirateBrainFor`, `defenceBrain`, `npcImpactDamage`,
`playerImpactDamage`) and the string `impact-damage` itself: neither harness
names any of them. Their `threat` hits are local variables of their own combat
loops.

Slice 8 did it for every name it moved, created, renamed or left behind —
the commander's six, the law's nine, the board's two, the market and hermit
six, jettison's five, the mission's five (old and new names), `RATINGS`, the
shop's four plus `EquipItem`, the trumbles' six, the living galaxy's four,
the commodity three, `SCOOP_RANGE` and `FAME_FULL` — plus `CONTRABAND_SET`
(deleted) and the career functions whose files changed. Neither harness
names any of them in a load-bearing way: their two hits are comments
(jameson-autopilot.js explaining why it must NOT recompute `FUEL_PRICE`, and
playtest.js's module list, whose stale "law.ts CONTRABAND" line now names
constants/law.ts). Both harnesses destructure only functions that are still
exported — `applyMarketPressure`, `isContraband`, `cargoTonnes`,
`cargoCapacity` — and all four still resolve.

Slice 5 did it for all twenty-two names it moved, renamed or created, and both
files were clean of every one of them. The only things either harness takes from
a file this slice touched are `distanceTenths` (still exported from
`galaxy/navigation.ts`) and `g.massLocked()` (still a method on Game), and both
still resolve. **`test/playtest.js` did hold a sixth home for the escape cost**
— `if (g.commander.fuel < 10) break; // no fuel to jump clear` — and it takes
`WITCHSPACE_ESCAPE_COST` out of `constants/jump.ts` now, alongside the
`PLAYER_FLIGHT` import it already had.

Slice 13 did it for the trainer's twenty-two moved names and the functions
whose files changed (`countPasses`, `waveTier`, `waveCount`, `waveEscalation`,
`openingFor`, `measureOpening`, `startExercise`): zero hits in either harness.

Slice 12 did it for `OBS_SPEED_SCALE`, the policy seam's sixteen STAYS names
and the encoder functions: both harnesses reach the seam only through
`kit.observeFor`, which is unchanged and still exported. (The trial
harness's own 280 pin — `tgView.speed = 280` — is a recorded survey finding
on the land-separately list, not a name this slice touched.)

Slice 11 did it for the six names it moved or created, the STAYS names
(`SAVE_RECORD_VERSION`, `SNAPSHOT_VERSION`, `SAVE_ID_PREFIX`, the two
namespaces, `BOOT_KEY`, `NEW_COMMANDER`) and `strandedHint`, `freshSession`
and `autoSaveTimer`: zero hits in either harness — both take
`useHarnessSaves`, `clearHarnessSaves` and `saveNamespace` from `storage.ts`
and nothing else save-shaped, and all three are still exported.

Slice 10 did it for all seventeen names it moved or created, the two it
retired (`GATE`, `LINED_UP`), `REFUSED`, `STATION_PRESENTATION_SCALE` and the
functions whose files changed (`planDocking`, `dockingOutcome`,
`inSlotChannel`, `rollAlignedWithSlot`, `slotRollOffset`, `makeDockPlan`,
`toggleDocking`, `buildStation`, `stationDockZ`, `buildSystemScene`): the one
hit is a playtest.js comment naming `rollAlignedWithSlot`, which is still
exported from `game/docking.ts`, and both harnesses fly docking through
`g.world.station` and the game's own methods rather than any constant.

Slice 9 did it for `CHART_SPAN_X`, `CHART_SPAN_Y`, `TECH_MIN` and `TECH_MAX`
plus the functions whose files changed (`Chart`, `emptyFilter`, `matches`,
`isUntouched`, `facetsOf`, `selectSlugs`, `generateGalaxy`,
`planetDescription`, `systemDescription`): neither harness names any of them.
Both reach `COMMODITIES` and `generateMarket` out of `galaxy/galaxy.ts`, which
this slice left untouched (it is DATA, not a constant), and both still resolve.

### `src/constants/` is in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — CLOSED by slice 14

The tree opens with the directory's entry: what it is, the leaf rule, the
read-it-whole instruction, and the data-is-not-constants exclusion. Slice 4
had already corrected the one line that had gone actively wrong —
`systems.ts` was described as holding "the save migration".

### `player-interest.ts` and `tactics.ts` were deleted

Both were a table or a single constant plus reasoning, with nothing left once
the values moved. Six comments in `npc.ts` naming them by filename were
repointed. If a future reader finds another dangling reference, it belongs here.
