# 29 — Rebaseline simulations, training and campaign combat

> Completed plan. Archived from the active queue.

**Kind:** AI / balance · **Severity:** high · **Size:** large
**Depends on:** 25, 28

## Why

Exact geometry, a larger roster and source-scale damage will change encounter
outcomes even though firing cadence and AI policy remain Harmless systems.
Trainers, saved brains and campaign gates must use the runtime model rather
than retain a parallel normalized approximation.

## Implementation

1. Extend simulation inputs/reports with player hull ID, fitted laser, NPC
   design/profile ID, initial/final source-scale systems and schema version.
2. Normalize health only at the AI observation boundary from exact current and
   maximum values.
3. Make scenario generation sample the expanded valid roster and call runtime
   combat functions for every damage path.
4. Evaluate existing brains unchanged first and archive deterministic
   before/after reports. Retrain only after schema and scenario parity are
   proven.
5. Exercise all 15 player combat profiles and all 38 recommended NPC/object
   profiles in evaluation, while excluding non-combat objects from misleading
   win-rate aggregates.
6. Retrain solo, pack and defence brains as needed, with separate training and
   held-out seeds.
7. Recalculate acceptance thresholds from multi-seed distributions. Exact
   combat-oracle gates are immutable and cannot be weakened for AI balance.
8. Rebaseline campaign survivability, combat score and bounty pacing without
   adding the deferred player shipyard or blueprint-set selector.
9. Run browser play trials for hit readability, time-to-kill, warning cadence,
   docking risk and representative old/new hull encounters.

## Carried over from TODO 26 — the Constrictor is unkillable

Source-exact rules make the Navy mission unwinnable for almost every
commander, and this is the balance call this TODO exists to make.

The Constrictor halves player hit strength before its 3 points of defence
subtract. A beam laser hits for 7, halves to 3, and does **zero** — the
pack's own `hits-to-destroy` row for Cobra Mk III / beam / G:28 is `null`.
A pulse laser needs 115 hits, 27.6 seconds of unbroken fire. Only a military
laser kills it in reasonable time. But the campaign says 100% of commanders
buy a beam and 3% ever buy a military laser.

TODO 26 shipped the source rule unaltered and did not work around it.

Chris's read, and it is the likelier one: most players doing Navy missions
will have upgraded to a military laser, as in the original. The 3% figure is
the CAMPAIGN BOT's purchasing policy, not human behaviour, so it measures the
bot rather than the game. That makes this a signposting problem rather than a
balance one — the military laser is 60,000 Cr at TL10+, so the question is
whether the briefing says what the job needs and whether the player can
reasonably have reached TL10 by then. Do not change the oracle.

## Carried over from TODO 27 — some attackers cannot hurt you at all

The Cobra Mk III's per-hit armour is 7 and an NPC laser hits for
`laserPower << 2`, so a laserPower of 1 does 4, which is nothing. Measured
over the live path: **119 of the 260 released builds do zero laser damage to
a Cobra Mk III**, and 9 of the 49 builds the roster can actually spawn. The
worst case is the **Asp Mk II, which flies as both a pirate and a bounty
hunter and cannot scratch the player** — it will chase, shoot, and never win.

**A pack does not fix this.** Armour subtracts from EACH hit before the shield
sees it, so zero does not accumulate. The Asp's laser is 4 points against a
minimum armour of 4 (the Adder), and it does exactly 0 to all fifteen flyable
hulls. Ten Asps firing for a minute take nothing off. Ramming and missiles are
the only ways such a ship can threaten anyone.

Everything else chips: a typical pirate does 9 points against a 510-point
front-face pool, so a Cobra Mk III soaks about 57 pirate laser hits where it
used to take 19. Non-laser damage went the other way and now bites 1.5x
harder — a station scrape is 45% of that pool, a missile 65%.

Decide here whether threat comes from cadence, numbers, accuracy or a named
Harmless deviation on armour. Do not change the oracle.

## Reproducibility

Record commands, seeds, scenario counts, catalogue manifest hash, schema
version and brain artifact hashes. Reports must distinguish source-rule changes
from AI retraining effects.

## Acceptance

- Runtime and trainer import the same combat/profile functions.
- Simulations are deterministic for the same seed and configuration.
- All trained artifacts pass held-out structural and outcome gates.
- Campaign checks cover early, middle and late combat threat bands.
- A concise browser trial log records accepted balance deviations.

## Verify

Run simulator parity, training/evaluation, campaign and standard verification,
then complete and record the browser trials.
