# Elite (1984) → HARMLESS — Gap Analysis

Feature parity against the original game manual (elitehomepage.org),
Wikipedia's Elite article, and the byte-level algorithm references used for
the galaxy/market code.

The ship tables and the laser arithmetic come from a vendored analysis pack of
the released Elite-A ship files. What is exact, what is a clean recreation and
what is ours is one table in [ELITE-A.md](ELITE-A.md).

## Implemented

| Area | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Galaxy generation | Byte-accurate: 8 galaxies × 256 systems; names, economy, government, tech level, population, productivity, radius, species, and the original's "goat soup" planet descriptions (Lave's canonical line is asserted by `npm test`). |
| Market & trading | Original 17-commodity price/quantity model, per-visit fluctuation, buy/sell, 20t/35t hold, kg/g exemption. Market estimates for any charted system (M on the charts). |
| Charts | Galactic chart + Short Range Chart with names, 7 LY fuel circle, keyboard or click targeting, type-to-find, market estimates, and the full DATA ON SYSTEM page. Ours, not the original's: the living galaxy is drawn on both — a red ring on every system reporting pirate activity, and T cycling the freight lanes actually in flight and the worlds trading well off the 1984 baseline. |
| Hyperspace | Real chart distances, fuel cost, 5-second countdown, break-pattern tunnel. Witchpoint arrivals 12 planet-radii out on the station's side. Galactic Hyperdrive (one-shot, TL10). |
| Witch-space | Mis-jumps (9%, 22% on the courier mission) drop you among Thargoids with Thargon drones; 1.0 LY escape jump; strand yourself without fuel and a distress beacon (B) buys a tow at the cost of your cargo. |
| Stations | Rotating Coriolis with docking slot; dodecahedral Dodo stations at TL10+; manual docking with roll alignment + on-screen alignment aid; docking computer (C, TL9); launch/dock tunnel effect; policed safety zone. |
| Flight | Elite-style nose-steering with keyboard-analogue rates; classic 1984 key layout by default (modern WASD toggle); torus drive (J) with mass-lock; four views (1-4); pause. |
| Combat | Pulse/beam/military lasers with heat, four laser mounts (front/rear/left/right), the original's missile arm→lock sequence (yellow then red pylon), ECM, energy bomb, tracer bolts, hit flashes, explosion debris, collisions, bounties. On-screen target brackets with range, hull bar and a lead marker. |
| Damage model | The released game's own arithmetic: a laser's hit decoded from its byte, a target's defence from its own energy bank, and a 255-point fore shield, a 255-point aft shield and a 255-point energy bank with an ENERGY LOW warning. Hull hits destroy cargo or knock out fittings; cabin temperature (sun proximity), escape pod, death → reload last save. Every path and its unit: [DAMAGE-PATHS.md](DAMAGE-PATHS.md). |
| Equipment | The manual's price/tech-level table: cargo bay, ECM, four laser mounts, beam/military lasers with old-laser refund, fuel scoops, escape pod, energy bomb, extra energy unit, docking computer, mining laser, galactic hyperdrive — plus a Combat Computer (see deviations). |
| Mining & scooping | Mining laser fragments asteroids into ore canisters; fuel scoops collect cargo canisters and sun-skim for fuel. |
| Legal system | CLEAN → OFFENDER → FUGITIVE; police contraband scans; bounty hunters stalk offenders; fines on docking; escape pod launders your record. |
| Ship roster | All 38 released designs are built, profile-resolvable and viewable (`/viewer`), and 31 of them turn up in play: Cobra Mk III, Cobra Mk I, Sidewinder, Viper, Adder, Krait, Mamba, Fer-de-Lance, Python, Anaconda, Boa, Gecko, Moray, Worm, Shuttle, Shuttle Mk II, Transporter, Dragon, Monitor, Ophidian, Ghavial, Bushmaster, Rattler, Iguana, Chameleon, Thargoid, Thargon, Constrictor, plus the missile, the cargo canister and the escape capsule — every one the released vertex/edge/face table rather than an approximation, at one scale, with the released targetable radius driving hit registration. The Asp Mk II is built and viewable but flies nowhere: no released build of it can take a point off any flyable hull. Which role may fly which hull is read off the released blueprint slots (`src/game/ship-roles.ts`), not chosen by eye; which BUILD of it a job flies is `src/game/role-variants.ts`. |
| NPC ecosystem | Traders arrive from deep space, work the station lane and jump out; pirates hunt the player and prey on traders; police hunt pirates; lone bounty hunters; NPC-vs-NPC combat. Piracy scales with government type, traffic with productivity. |
| Missions | Station bulletin board (cargo, courier and bounty contracts with day-based deadlines) available from the first landing, plus the Constrictor hunt and the classified courier run (16+ kills, galaxy 1). |
| Living galaxy | A level-1 simulation runs trade between all 256 systems while you play: convoys depart on productivity, are lost to piracy in lawless space, and arrive as real traders in whatever system you're in. Prices drift ±25% from the 1984 baseline with supply, pirate hotspots emerge along lawless routes, and system news reports it. |
| Encounters | Escape capsules from destroyed ships (scoopable, with consequences), station defence Vipers, rock hermits that trade ore and ask no questions, derelict generation ships, and Trumbles. |
| Progression | Kills → Harmless … E L I T E; save-on-dock; save export/import. |
| Console | Elliptical 3D scanner, compass, gauges, missile pylons, the energy readout in four banks (see deviations), S (station in range) and E (ECM detected) indicator lights. |
| Presentation | Wireframe hidden-line ships, shader sun and planets, phosphor HUD, WebAudio synth, in-game controls guide. Mouse throughout: pointer-lock flight, clickable menus/markets/equipment, click-to-target on the charts. |
| Ship AI | No neural policy ships: all three pilots are code (`src/game/brains.ts`). Pirates fly `pursuit` (chase onto your six, break into a slashing pass when you turn your nose on them); armed traders turn and fight with `attack-run` (close, fire through the pass, come round again), while the bought combat computer flies a pure-pursuit co-pilot under the same name (`scripted-co-pilot.ts`); `scripted` is the hand-written attack run kept as the pirates' A/B runtime toggle, and on the defence it means none. |

## Remaining

1. **Gamepad support** — flight is keyboard and mouse (pointer-lock) only;
   nothing in `src/` reads the Gamepad API (`getGamepads`/`gamepadconnected`).
   A pad would want axis-mapped pitch/roll and button-bound weapons and views.
2. **A player shipyard** — all 15 flyable hulls are imported, resolve, and are
   read by live combat through the commander's saved `shipId`; nothing can yet
   change which one you fly. With it come the per-hull flight profiles, the
   Adder start and the per-mount laser redesign. The deferred list, and what a
   purchase would have to do, is in [ELITE-A.md](ELITE-A.md).
3. **Selecting a blueprint set by system** — all 23 released S.A-S.W sets and
   all 713 slot assignments are imported; what runs is one deterministic
   recommended build per design plus a role-based override. Choosing the set by
   technology, government and galaxy is a swap of that policy and nothing else.
4. **Contract variety** — the bulletin board covers cargo, courier and
   bounty work; passenger berths and smuggling runs would widen it.
Surfacing the living galaxy was item 5 here and is now in the table above:
docs/TODO/111 and 114 put the danger, the freight network and the price
divergences on both charts. GitHub #10.

## Deliberate deviations

- Shader-rich sun and planets instead of flat 1984 circles — the founding
  goal of the project.
- Station collisions damage and bounce you rather than killing instantly.
- **Traders dock.** In the original you saw ships use the station; here they
  fly the slot properly, sharing the autopilot with your own docking computer
  (src/game/docking.ts). About half of arriving traders put in; the rest
  jump out as before.
- Galactic hyperdrive on ⇧H instead of the manual's "G then H" chord (G
  opens the chart here; U is missile unarm, as in the original).
- Views on 1-4 and screens on letters, because browsers claim F1-F12.
- **Pirates size you up before they commit.** The original scaled hostility
  with your *combat rating*; here it scales with what you're visibly worth
  (`pirateThreat` in src/game/threat.ts) — cargo, hold size, fitted laser,
  reputation, and regional notoriety from your recent sales. Poor commanders
  meet opportunists in Sidewinders, rich ones meet organised gangs — two
  ringleaders in Fer-de-Lances, Pythons or Cobras, plus hangers-on a tier
  below them, all flying the same `pursuit` dogfighter every other pirate flies
  (`pirateBrainNameFor` ignores tier and organisation). Rationale: an economic
  motive is explicable to the player and gives them levers (bank the money,
  fly armed, lie low) where a hidden difficulty curve gives them none.
  Threat grows deliberately sub-linearly with the prize so upgrades stay felt.
- **The rating ladder counts difficulty, not bodies.** The original scored
  every kill the same, which made the fastest route to E L I T E farming the
  weakest thing you could find, and made the top of the ladder a flat grind.
  A gang's Fer-de-Lance is worth five Sidewinders (`killValue` in
  commander.ts). `kills` is still the literal body count on the status screen;
  `combatScore` is what the ladder reads. The iconic 25,600 is untouched.
- **Fame draws challengers.** In the original, reputation only ever made you
  safer. Here it cuts both ways: a reputation deters thieves after easy cargo
  (it lowers `appeal`) while drawing people who want to be the ones who killed
  you. At Dangerous, ~35% of receptions are someone coming for the name rather
  than the hold — which is what stops the endgame being a grind, and is the
  reason a famous commander gets hunted flying an empty ship.
- **Player gunnery is a ray against the hull**, not a cone around a sphere.
  A cone sized from the target's *maximum* radius makes every ship a ball: an
  Anaconda would be no easier to hit down its long flank than head-on, and
  shots would land on empty space beside thin hulls. The shot is cast at the
  actual mesh, with a small graze tolerance for beam width. Measured: an
  Anaconda is 1.3° nose-on and 2.5° broadside; a Sidewinder 1.6° across its
  wings and 0.6° vertically.
- **The player's Cobra is more agile than the 1984 numbers imply**
  (pitch 1.45 rad/s, roll 2.5). NPC fighters pitch at `turnRate × 1.4`, so
  small hulls turn inside you — as they should — but at the original 1.1 they
  turned inside you so far that holding a bead was hopeless.
- **Jettisoning cargo (Y) buys off pirates.** Not in the original, which had
  no such out. They came for the goods; dumping a proportional share makes
  them break off — turning an unwinnable fight into a decision.
- **Turn-rate ramp is `1 - exp(-rate·dt)`, not `min(1, rate·dt)`.** Every rate
  in this game is per SECOND, not per frame, so the top turn rate is the same at
  any refresh; only the ramp toward it was frame-rate dependent, and now it is
  not. Constants are calibrated so 60Hz is bit-identical to what shipped.
- **Stations are drawn four times larger, relative to ships, than the source
  tables place them.** The *hulls* are exact — the Coriolis and the Dodo are
  released vertex tables like every ship — but they are the only objects in the
  game that do not go through the one geometry conversion. Through it a Coriolis
  would be 40 world units against the Cobra's 23.75, or 1.7 Cobras wide; here it
  is 160, or 4.7. `STATION_PRESENTATION_SCALE` in `src/ships/station-hulls.ts`
  is the single named place that says so. It exists because everything about
  docking is built on the wider station — `src/game/docking.ts` gates five
  station half-widths out, the launch standoff and the Vipers' stack are
  absolute distances — and shrinking the station fourfold would move all of them
  at once, which is a docking change and not a geometry one. The Dodo grew with
  it: its slot face is 196 world units out where the old hand-built
  dodecahedron's was 135.
- **The docking slot stands upright, as it does in the source.** The released
  Coriolis slot is a vertical 20x60 (the Dodo's a 32x64), so the exact hulls
  carry an upright letterbox and the roll you hold to fly it turns with them.
  The tolerance channel is a 52x124 rectangle rotated to match, and the roll
  tolerance is 0.65 rad; over a uniform sample of approach offsets and rolls the
  fraction that docks is 6.68%.
- **Asteroids are generated, not tabulated.** The released Asteroid, Boulder and
  Splinter all fix a rock at radius 20; here they are jittered icosahedra with a
  size drawn from their seed between 25 and 70 (`buildAsteroid`), because a
  field where every rock is identical is worse to fly through and the size
  variety is what makes one worth aiming at. The three exact designs stay
  registered, profile-resolvable and viewable — the deviation is which mesh the
  `asteroid` role spawns, not which designs exist.
- **The two Harmless-only ships carry stated energy, not recovered energy.** The
  rock hermit and the derelict generation ship have no released design, so they
  cannot have a released bank. Both are written down in `game/npc-energy.ts`
  with a reason and are excluded from every claim of source parity: the hermit
  is a STATION, so it takes the station rule — immune to player lasers, 240
  points, no regeneration — and the derelict gets 252, the heaviest bank the
  catalogue holds, and recovers nothing because its reactors are cold. The
  visible change is that a rock hermit can no longer be shot down.
- **The console reads energy in four banks, and the ship has one pool.** The
  original's dashboard showed four energy banks and a pilot flew by how many
  were left. This project uses a single 255-point pool, but keeps the four-bank
  READING rather than drawing energy as a bar like the shields it is now the
  same size as, because "two banks left, break off" is a decision a player makes
  at a glance where "0.43" is a number they have to think about — and because
  the four-bank console is one of the most recognisable things about the 1984
  screen. The segments are quarters of one pool. `ENERGY_BANKS` in
  `src/game/systems.ts` is the single place that says four: `LOW_ENERGY` is
  derived from it, and `energyLow()` is the single place that says where the
  last bank BEGINS, so the segment the gauge turns red, the ENERGY LOW the step
  announces and the point at which shields stop recharging are one comparison
  read three times — inclusive, so there is no value at which the shields are
  frozen and the console is quiet. The gauge's own segments are built from
  `ENERGY_BANKS` rather than written into `play.html`.
- **The mining laser is still a fitting, not a mount.** The pack gives every
  flyable hull a mining-laser byte and `playerLaserHit()` answers for it, but
  Harmless has no fourth mount to select: `miningLaser` is equipment that
  changes what a destroyed rock yields. The equipment redesign that turns it
  into a real mounted weapon is deferred by the combat plan.
- Fuel priced at 0.4 Cr/LY (the manual's table implies 0.2 Cr/LY).
  The rate is `FUEL_PRICE` in `src/game/shop.ts` — change it there, with every
  other price.
- A **Combat Computer** (TL9, 20000 Cr) with no 1984 equivalent: it hands
  your ship to the `attack-run` defence pilot for as long as you hold a fight.
- A **combat training simulator** (`T` when docked, free, every station), which
  the original had no equivalent of. Two reasons, and the second is the
  load-bearing one: a player can learn what a Fer-de-Lance does differently from
  a Sidewinder without paying for the lesson with a career, and the AI can be
  judged against a human instead of only against other AI. Every exercise
  exports a JSON record.

  Its **waves** mode is the furthest from anything in the original, and
  deliberately so: it sends a Thargoid and a Thargon at wave 18, which the
  released game only ever does in witch-space. That is a simulator sending what
  a simulator can send, not a change to what the galaxy spawns — `encounters.ts`
  is untouched — and the whole ramp is a Harmless selection policy over released
  hulls and released builds. The one thing it leaves behind, the furthest wave
  reached, is not a rating and nothing in the career reads it.

  The rule that makes it defensible is that **nothing which happens in it
  leaves it**: no kills, no `combatScore`, no credits, no legal status, no cargo
  or equipment lost, no save write, and death ends the exercise rather than the
  career. It must not advance you toward E L I T E — that requires real kills.
  Your own ship's FIT-OUT is selectable inside an exercise (lasers, shields,
  E.C.M., missiles, energy unit and bomb) but the HULL is not: the player's hull
  is four constants in `player.ts`, and `ai-training/scenario.ts` reads them as
  the target every pirate brain was fitted against. Design in
  `docs/COMBAT-SIM.md`.
- **Contracts from day one.** The original gated missions behind a high
  combat rating; here a bulletin board gives every commander work from the
  first landing. Recognisable, but kinder.
- **Rock hermits** and **Trumbles** are affectionate borrowings from
  [Oolite](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Rock_Hermit_(Oolite)), not the
  1984 game; **generation ships** come from the Elite fiction (Ian Bell
  notes they were never coded). This project is a homage, not a museum
  piece — see the deviations above.

## Non-laser damage is Harmless policy (deliberate deviation)

The Elite-A analysis pack tabulates registered LASER hits exhaustively — 15,600
player-to-NPC rows and 3,900 NPC-to-player rows — and says nothing whatever
about what a ram, a canister breaking on the hull, a Coriolis wall, a missile
warhead or an energy bomb is worth. Those numbers are therefore **ours**, and
they are labelled as ours: `src/game/impact-damage.ts` is their only home, and
none of them may be quoted as an Elite-A fact.

**The rule.** An impact costs a fixed whole number of source points, stated
separately for a ship's energy bank and for the commander's pools, and is spent
on whatever it hits without asking what that is.

Two columns rather than one, because the two banks are not comparable: a
released ship carries 2 to 255 energy, and the commander carries a 255-point
facing shield in front of a 255-point bank. Fixed points rather than a share of
the target, because a hull's size is meant to be worth something — the same
44-point scrape is a third of a Sidewinder and a sixth of an Anaconda.

**The anchors**, both the Cobra Mk III, and both re-derived from the catalogue
by `test/damage-paths.test.ts` so a re-import cannot leave them stale:

| impact | ship | commander | severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ram | 44 | 115 | 45% of the 98-point NPC anchor / of a 255-point shield face |
| canister on the hull | — | 15 | 6% of a face |
| station scrape | — | 230 | 90% of a face |
| missile warhead | 250 | 250 | flattens a full face exactly; above every released bank but five of 260 builds |
| energy bomb | 255 | — | the top of the byte scale — nothing released survives it |

The warhead is 250 either way, so the five heaviest released builds survive one
at full energy by a sliver, and only an actual kill pays a bounty.

**NPC-versus-NPC laser fire is a composition, not an invention.** The pack does
not tabulate that direction, so `npcCrossfireDamage` uses the two source rules
that each half of it does have — the firing build's own `laserPower << 2` and
the defending build's own `maxEnergy & 7` — through the same oracle the two
player-facing directions use.

**The Constrictor's halving and a station's immunity are properties of a PLAYER
LASER.** They are fields on the target's profile, read by the player's shot and
by nothing else: a crossfire hit on the Constrictor is not halved, and a ram on a
station is not shrugged off. The impact functions are not even given a target to
ask, which is the structural version of the same rule.

The whole inventory — every path, its unit and its owner — is
`docs/DAMAGE-PATHS.md`.

## Aim assist and the ring sight (deliberate deviation)

The 1984 game had a cross and no assist: a shot hit if the target's silhouette
covered the sight. We keep the ray test that does exactly that, and add an
angular allowance on top — a fixed 2 degrees at knife range, tapering to
nothing by 2400 units so distance shooting still demands precision.

Why deviate. A Sidewinder at 500 units subtends 1.9 degrees. Holding a mouse
or a key inside that while both ships manoeuvre is most of why fights read as
flailing, and it is the half of the combat problem that belongs to the player
rather than to the AI. NPCs fire whenever the geometric gate allows.

Two things keep it honest rather than a cheat:

- The cross became a **ring**, drawn from the projection to the exact angle of
  the assist. Anything inside the ring is inside the envelope, so the sight
  states the rule instead of hiding it. The ring lights when a shot would
  actually connect at the current range.
- The cockpit beams **bend onto the target** they found. Chris's point, and
  the right one: an allowance that silently converts a near miss into a hit
  reads as a bug, where beams that visibly converge read as the gunsight doing
  its job.

Recognisability was the constraint (CLAUDE.md: homage, not museum piece). The
sight keeps a centre pip so it still reads as a gunsight rather than a modern
soft-lock, and nothing tracks or snaps — the ship's nose still has to be put
near the target.
