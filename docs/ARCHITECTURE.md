# Architecture — a tour for new readers

## The portability test

Chris's, and it is better than "is this module leaky?" because it has an
answer rather than an opinion: **if we wanted a desktop build with the same
core engine, could we do it?**

`npm run portability` answers it, and the answer is not written down here on
purpose — a table of line counts is stale the next time a file is added, and
this one was, by thousands of lines. Run it. It prints three buckets:

```
ports unchanged   the reusable rules and simulation
platform          composition root, renderer, HUD, screens, input, audio, storage
contaminated      a core runtime path that reaches a platform module
```

Roughly seven lines in ten are portable, and the ONLY number that is a promise
is the third one: **contaminated is zero**, and the tool exits non-zero if it
is not.

The generated catalogue, the combat oracle, the identities and the roster are
all pure data and pure rules, so they land on the left-hand side.

The third number is the one to drive down. The gate follows relative runtime
imports transitively (ignoring erased type-only edges), so a file cannot look
clean in isolation while reaching a platform module through a chain. Every
contaminated line prints that chain and makes `npm run portability` fail.
`game.ts` is the platform composition root: no reusable module imports it (the
gate asserts only `main.ts` does), and it constructs the Input, HUD and screens
that apply the core modules' reported outcomes.

A test suite will not catch that number regressing. This will.

## The north star

**One world state. A pure step that advances it. A renderer that only reads it.**

Everything else is a consequence, and each consequence is testable:

| property | what it buys | where it stands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the snapshot IS the state | save anywhere, replay, test fixtures | mostly — see the gaps below |
| `step()` is seeded and fixed-dt | the same inputs give the same run | done |
| the renderer never writes state | you can delete it and still simulate | **done** — the step reports presentation effects to the platform composition root |
| the world builds without a browser | training against the real step | **done** — `World.build()` runs under node |
| ...and STEPS without one | the trainer can use the real engine | **done** — `world-step.ts`, stepped headless by `npm test` |
| one rule, one home | the bug class that ate this codebase | mostly |
| every rule is unit-testable headless | `npm test` prints the count; no browser | done |
| nothing knows about its caller | modules compose in any order | done |

The recurring failure this is defending against is **one rule with two homes,
kept in step by hope** — the bug class that ate this codebase.

**The rule for what a module may know (Chris's framing — single
responsibility, and things should not need to know about each other):** a
module may depend on data, on leaf utilities, and on the `World` if it
genuinely lives in the sky. It may **not** depend on the shape of its caller.

The tell is a callback that reaches back out — `message()`, `add()`,
`remove()` — or a hand-rolled `SomethingContext` interface. Both mean the
module cannot be used, or tested, without something Game-shaped standing
behind it.

**They are all still there, all in `src/game/screens/`** — one `*Context` per
screen, which `grep -rn 'export interface .*Context' src/game/screens/` will
count for you rather than this sentence going stale. The worst is `TradeContext`
(three callbacks out, including `leaveHermit()`, a screen telling the Game to
change flight state). `collisions.ts` also takes a `setPlayerSpeed` callback.
The pattern that replaced the others, and that these should follow:

> **A module decides and reports. The caller applies the consequences.**

`stepTrumbles` returns events and `trumbleMessage` phrases them. `checkJump`
returns a refusal and the Game decides a refusal is a beep. `Ordnance.arm()`
returns `'noMissiles'`; it has never heard of a HUD. This is why ordnance can be
unit-tested without constructing a Game at all.

Only `main.ts` imports `game.ts`. That arrow points one way and should stay
that way; if a module starts wanting the Game, the answer is a return value.

**The rule for what belongs in state:** anything that drives behaviour and is
not a constant. A value worked out at runtime — even once, even at spawn — is
state. AI state is game state: a human's brain survives a reload on its own,
an NPC's does not.

### Known gaps against it

- `game.ts` is the longest file in the project;
  `npm run sizes` prints today's figure and the allowlist entry in
  `tools/sizes.mjs` carries the reason. It is the orchestrator, and what
  is left is mostly orchestration: the fixed-timestep loop, the command
  switch, the docked/flight mode machine, and the consequences the modules
  report. The rules live in the ~30 files around it, and the **world step
  itself** is `world-step.ts`: the five phases of flight, reporting
  `StepEvent`s rather than calling a HUD. It
  runs under node with no Hud, no Input and no renderer (`npm test` flies 600
  steps of it and asserts the run replays byte-identically), which is what the
  trainer needs. What it cannot own it asks for through `StepHost` — eleven
  verbs and one question, all of them consequences that reach outside the sky
  (a bounty, a legal status, a save, a screen, the end of the run). One of them
  carries a fact only the step has: `applyPlayerDamage` names its
  `DamageSource`, because what hurt you is known statically at each of the five
  places it bills you and can only be guessed at afterwards from the size of
  the number.
- **The same shape three times over.** `persistence.ts` (capture, restore,
  autosave, resume) and `station.ts` (dock, launch, the menu between them) came
  out the same way: a module that decides and reports, one host object literal
  in `game.ts` naming the verbs it may ask for, and one small `apply*` switch.
  The save can now be taken and put back under node — `npm test` flies a world,
  captures it through JSON, restores into a fresh state and demands the
  restored world *continues* the run rather than merely resembling it, which is
  the property snapshot bugs break.
- **The rule for what may be an event, and it is not style:** anything that
  DRAWS from the seeded rng must stay a direct call, made where it was made
  before. Deferring a draw moves it across a branch and silently changes every
  seeded outcome after it. That is why `StepHost` and `StationHost` are lists of
  verbs rather than richer return values — `populateSystem`, the Navy mission
  step and the market roll all draw. Messages draw nothing, so messages are
  events.
- `npc.ts` is the other file `npm run sizes` calls DEBT: it holds both behaviour
  and brain flight, and the flight half wants its own file.
- State is now `Game.state` (`state.ts`) — one object holding the galaxy, the
  commander, the world, the player, the session, the ship systems, the dock
  plan, the markets and the charts. `freshState(commander)` builds it under
  node with no canvas and no browser. Game code uses that canonical object
  directly. The console-only `legacyHandles()` view keeps getter conveniences
  such as `g.commander` for old untyped harnesses without adding a second
  writable path to the Game class. The station's quaternion is still
  snapshotted by hand.
- **Flight** now has an intent layer: `PlayerShip.update(dt, demand)` takes a
  `FlightDemand` (rates, throttle, trigger) and the pilots produce one —
  `engine/flight-controls.ts` from a keyboard, `combat-computer.ts` from the
  defence brain, a harness by writing four numbers down. `player.ts` no longer
  imports `Input`, and `game.ts` has one path: produce a demand, apply it.
- **...and so does the rest of the keyboard.** `controls.ts` is the same move
  for the discrete half: a binding TABLE over a two-method `CommandInput`,
  turning taps into `Command`s that `game.ts`'s `runCommand` applies in
  one-liners. The player, an AI and a replay are the same interface —
  `commandsFor()` plus `runCommand()` is the whole path, and `{ pressed, held }`
  is all a driver needs. It is in the purity block, and `npm test` asserts what
  keys do (the ⇧ modifiers, one command per frame, the confirmation swallowing
  everything). The docking computer is the remaining holdout on the flight side
  — it asks for a HEADING rather than a rate, and still steers on top.
- **The constructor needs no browser.** `Game` takes a `ShellFactory`
  (`engine/shell.ts`) rather than a canvas, so `new Game(() => headlessShell())`
  constructs and STEPS under node.
  `headlessShell()` is not a stub the tests tolerate — it is the proof the seam
  is real, and several test files build a whole Game on it. `npm test` also
  asserts `game.ts` names no DOM API at all, because TypeScript will not: the
  DOM types are ambient, so `window.innerWidth` type-checks fine in a file that
  can never run.

easy to trip over, and where to look when you want to change something.

## The 30-second map

**This is an index, not an explanation.** One line per file: the question it
answers. If you need more than that, read the file — every one opens with a
header comment saying what it owns and what it deliberately does not. A file
that needs a paragraph here to make sense is a file with the wrong name, and
the fix belongs there rather than in this document.

    scripted-co-pilot.ts    the scripted combat computer: a PURSUIT DOGFIGHTER
                            flying YOUR ship — gets on the target's six and
                            shoots, and this is what the co-pilot flies today
    pitch-roll-steer.ts     bank-to-turn: pointing the commander's yaw-less nose
                            at a place with pitch and roll alone, as stick
                            commands the same ramp a human's keys feed
    threat-lock.ts          which threat a defending ship fights: the nearest,
                            but committed to — one home for the co-pilot, the
                            armed trader and the training target
    autopilot.ts            is something else flying, and what does it want?

    combat-sim.ts           the training exercise: a real fight that costs
                            nothing — the commander swap, the entry snapshot,
                            its own StepHost
    combat-sim-scenarios.ts who it sends at you, and when it stops sending —
                            the seven fights, the wave ramp (numbers, then the
                            four stated steps past it) and the three modes
    combat-sim-opening.ts   where an exercise is fought and where the two sides
                            start it: the arena centre, the per-scenario arc,
                            range and cone, and the geometry the record quotes
    combat-sim-report.ts    what happened, counted — how you flew, how THEY
                            flew, and the JSON that exports
    combat-sim-strip.ts     how it is going, WHILE it is going: the cockpit
                            strip's model, read off the round's own recorder
    combat-sim-compare.ts   two records held against each other — and what may
                            NOT be differenced: a confound is named, not shown
                            as a result

                            it holds a layout preference, not a career
    save-file.ts            what a save IS — its name, its id, the one line a
                            player tells two of them apart by, and what loading

      saves.ts              the commander file: the list, the run you are in as
                            a line above it, and the question ENTER asks before
                            a load. Opening it writes NOTHING
      save-naming.ts        typing a name at the station — naming a SAVE, and
                            renaming the COMMANDER, which changes what you are
                            called and deliberately does not move your saves
      typed-name.ts         one frame of typing a name, shared by the three

      save-transfer.ts      a save leaving the browser as a JSON file, and

      combat-sim.ts         the trainer's front of house: pick a fight, read the

      combat-sim-setup.ts   what the pilot picked, and the rows that show it
      combat-sim-notes.ts   what the panel says under the rows, and the tallest

                            COMMAND_HELP and from no copy of them

  engine/shell.ts           THE PLATFORM SEAM: everything the game needs from
                            the machine it runs on, in one small interface
  engine/browser-shell.ts   that seam, against a browser — every DOM and
                            window API the game uses is in this one file
  engine/inert-dom.ts       a DOM element that accepts every write and does
                            none of them, so a painter with no DOM is inert
  engine/render-stack.ts    the ONLY file that needs a GPU
  engine/input.ts           keyboard state (held/pressed/counts), and the

                            shared by trainer, tournament and viewer
    brains/*.json           the socket for trained weights — empty today (only

                            exactly what brains.ts imports (nothing, now)
  viewer/stage.ts           canvas, camera, bloom and starfield: what the two
                            dev pages share, and all they share
  viewer/scenarios.ts       the combat viewer's rows — DOM-free, so `npm test`
                            builds and flies every one (docs/TODO/102)
  viewer/main.ts            the combat viewer's page: the DOM shell over

    chart.ts                the 256-world map: a canvas, a pan, a zoom, a hit

    entry.ts                one world's data and its markup — `entryHtml()` runs
                            in Node (the static index) and the browser (the
                            panel), so there is no SEO copy to drift
    filters.ts              which worlds the rail shows: pure, a filter and a

## The five ideas that explain most of the code

### 1. The 1984 galaxy is generated, never stored

`src/galaxy/galaxy.ts` reimplements the original Elite algorithm: three
16-bit seed words advanced by a Fibonacci-style "twist" generate all 256
systems per galaxy — names (digraph table), economy, government, tech level,
population, and market prices. Galaxy 1 is byte-identical to the 1984
original (system 7 is Lave; run the game and check the Short Range Chart
against any Elite fan site). **Never edit generated values; everything
downstream derives from the seeds.** Per-system visuals (planet colour,
coastlines, sun bearing, station orbit) also derive from the seed, in
`world/system-scene.ts` and the planet shader.

### 2. Ships are 1984-style data tables, turned to face −Z

A hull is explicit `vertices`, `edges` and `faces`, the same style as the
original BBC data and **the same convention: +Z is the nose**. three.js flies
down **−Z**, so `buildShip()` turns the def by a **half turn about Y** —
negating x and z. It must be a rotation, not a Z mirror alone: a mirror is
identical for a left/right symmetric hull but a mirror image for anything else,
and eight of the 38 released designs are asymmetric.

The hulls themselves are **generated, not written**. `ships/elite-a-hulls.ts`
converts the released tables in `game/elite-a/geometry.generated.ts`, and
`sourceGeometryToWorld()` is the one conversion: **one world unit is four
source units**, anchored so the Cobra Mk III keeps the size it always had.
The same conversion produces the **target radius** every ray test and
collision uses, so hit registration matches the released ships rather than a
hand-tuned guess. `ships/registry.ts` is how anything asks for either.

The source stores no polygons — a face is a normal, and an edge says which
two faces it lies between — so `ships/elite-a-faces.ts` reconstructs closed
loops for the black fill and reports what it could not resolve.
`test/geometry.test.ts` pins those reports.

Each ship is two overlapping objects: `LineSegments` for the glowing edges,
plus a matte-black `Mesh` of the faces with `polygonOffset` pushing it just
behind the lines — that's the classic "hidden line" look, and it's why the
renderer must **not** use a logarithmic depth buffer (log-depth writes
gl_FragDepth, which disables polygon offset).

Scale: planets are ~4,500-6,500 radius and the sun sits ~320,000 out. The
**stations** are the one thing at 1 unit ≈ 1 source unit (320 across) rather
than at the ship scale — `STATION_PRESENTATION_SCALE` in
`ships/station-hulls.ts`, which says why: their hulls are the exact released
tables, but `game/docking.ts` gates five station half-widths out and the launch
standoff is an absolute distance, so shrinking them fourfold would be a docking
change. The slot itself is the source's own upright letterbox now, and the
tolerance channel turned with it.

### 3. One orchestrator, many dumb parts — and one rule, one home

`game/game.ts` owns the entities and the frame. It does **not** own the rules.

The pattern everywhere is: **a module decides, the orchestrator applies.** An
NPC never damages anything itself — `NpcShip.update` returns a `FireEvent` and
the Game rolls the dice, draws the tracer, applies damage and handles the legal
consequences. `collisions.ts` separates overlapping ships and *reports the
pairs*; the Game bills them, because the price is not symmetric (your shields
absorb a ram, and two NPCs colliding must not credit you with a kill).
`encounters.ts` says a pirate wave is due; the Game spawns it. A `Screen`
returns `'back'`; the host pops the stack.

That split is what makes the rules testable without a browser, and it is the
answer to the recurring bug in this codebase: **one rule with two homes, kept
in step by hope.** Prefer deleting a duplicate to writing a test that two copies
still agree.

Screens (`ui/screens.ts`) are pure render functions over DOM, routed by
`ui/screen-host.ts`; the HUD (`hud/hud.ts`) is a dumb painter fed one state
object per frame, computed by `hud/hud-model.ts`.

**Still mixed up in game.ts**, and worth knowing before you go looking: laser
fire, spawning, and the hyperspace *transition*. The flight loop lives in
`world-step.ts`, the save in `persistence.ts` and the docking/launch transitions
in `station.ts`, all three headless. Nothing blocks a browser-free `Game`: the
constructor asks for a `ShellFactory`, not a canvas, so the renderer and the DOM
listeners are `browser-shell.ts`'s and `game.ts` names no DOM API at all. The
command keys are not part of it either — `controls.ts` reads an input interface,
not a browser.

Two intentional oddities inside it:

- **Witch-space** reuses the normal system scene and simply teleports the
  planet, station and sun to ±1e8 — out of reach of every distance check —
  rather than introducing a nullable world type. Cheap, and every subsystem
  keeps working.
- **Docking** is evaluated in the station's local frame: the slot is a box
  on the local −Z face (`stationDockZ` differs between Coriolis and Dodo),
  plus a roll-alignment test against the slot's long axis.

### 4. NPCs: scripted behaviours, flown by hand-written pilots

`game/npc.ts` has a behaviour matrix (traders arrive/trade/depart, pirates
hunt in packs, police enforce, hunters stalk offenders, Thargons swarm).
Every pilot is **hand-written code** — no neural policy ships. `game/brains.ts`
imports no weights, so every name resolves to null and the `'brain'` flight
path in `npc.ts` is a dormant socket, never taken today. `game/brain-names.ts`
decides which named pilot flies for whom, so the ship and the combat trainer's
report cannot disagree; `npm test` reads those files rather than a list.

Three code pilots, and that is the whole list:

- **`pursuit`** — the shipped opposition. Pirates attacking the player fly the
  pursuit dogfighter: it chases onto the commander's six and holds there,
  breaking into the attack run's slashing pass the moment the nose comes onto
  it (`game/pursuit.ts`, `game/npc.ts`'s `pursue`).
- **`attack-run`** — the defence slots' name, and it is two flights. An armed
  trader turning to fight flies the hand-written three-phase run — close, fire
  through the pass, extend and come round (`game/attack-run.ts` via
  `game/npc.ts`'s defence path); the player's combat computer flies the
  pure-pursuit co-pilot on the commander's own ship
  (`game/scripted-co-pilot.ts`, chosen by this name in `game.ts`).
- **`scripted`** — the A/B control. It reverts every pirate to the plain
  three-phase attack run and switches the defence off — no co-pilot, and an
  armed trader flees instead of turning to fight — kept for the A/B:
  `__game.state.brains.scripted = true` from a console, or the PIRATES FLY row
  on the combat trainer's setup panel (`T` at any station).

The trained line no longer ships (docs/TRAINING-LOG.md runs 20-21 for why:
three retrains optimised their way out of fighting). `brainFly()` still exists,
public, as the seat a future candidate genome re-enters through — one flight
model, one place — but nothing fills it now.

### 5. Training runs on the game, not on a copy of it

`src/ai-training/scenario.ts` builds an `Episode` out of the engine: the
pirates are `NpcShip`s flying `NpcShip.brainFly`, the target is a `PlayerShip`
flown from a `FlightDemand`, the guns are `game/gunnery.ts`, the ramming is
`game/collisions.ts`, the dice are `game/rng.ts`, and the step is `FIXED_DT`.
Node runs it with no canvas and no WebGL; the browser viewer replays the same
episodes.

What is genuinely about training stays here: the fitness functions, the
opponent pool, the escape range, and the observation encoder. The policies'
observation is ship-frame relative (`policy.ts` docstring), which is what makes
them position/orientation invariant.

A combat number has one home, so a balance change moves the game and the
training environment together — which also means it invalidates the shipped
brains rather than merely desyncing them. Retrain; do not re-copy.

Resolution — "an NPC fired, now what" — is invariant 15's other side, and it
has one home too (docs/TODO/64): the resolver `game/fire-resolution.ts`, which
both `world-step.ts` and `scenario.ts` call.
It owns the four things that decide a fight — spend the round, roll the hit,
choose the damage, push it into the target — over a `FireWorld` of four members:
which hull the target is, where it is, what a hit does to it, and what to do with
a ship shot out of the sky. That is the same seam this codebase uses for the
platform (`engine/shell.ts`), for the orchestrator (`StepHost`) and for a sky to
put a warhead in (`OrdnanceWorld`): a narrow interface each side implements, with
the rules above it in one file. What stays with the caller is presentation — the
tracer, the bang, the `npcFired` report on one side; the accuracy tally on the
other — because *a tracer is presentation and the shield face is a rule*, and
that split is the whole design. `game/shield-face.ts` is the smallest piece of
it: which of her two shields takes a hit, asked by `Combat.hitPlayer` and by the
episode's target, and written once.

The gate is `test/fire-resolution.test.ts`: the same `FireEvent` and the same
seed through BOTH callers, asserting identical damage, identical rack and
identical pools, over ten fixtures that reach every branch and both sides of
every roll. It is checked for vacuity the way `npm test`'s bans are — gut a
branch of the resolver, or re-grow a copy of it in one caller, and the file
fails.

The one remaining divergence is docs/TODO/73, and it is in the DECIDING half: an
episode never hands a brain-flown pirate over to the scripted break-off the way
`NpcShip.update` does inside the brain's guard range, so a training pirate never
completes a pass.

### 6. Pirates are businesses, not a difficulty slider

`pirateThreat()` in `game/threat.ts` decides your reception from a **mark**
— what a pirate can observe (cargo value, contraband, hold size, fitted laser,
kills, regional notoriety). It returns a count, a *tier* and whether they're *organised*. The tier describes the *group*, not every ship in it:
`memberTier()` gives the first one or two members the full tier and drops the
rest a rung, so a gang is ringleaders plus hangers-on. `ship-specs.ts` owns the
hulls (`pirateSpecForTier`), `threat.ts` owns the rule — so the campaign
simulator resolves each attacker at the strength the game actually spawns. Two
rules keep it from rubber-banding: only visible
things count — never credits in the bank — and threat grows sub-linearly with
the prize, so the player outgrows the galaxy slowly rather than never.

Reputation is deliberately two-sided. It lowers `appeal` (thieves want easy
cargo, not a fight) but rolls a separate *challenge*: at Dangerous, ~35% of
receptions are an organised group who came for the name. It has to roll, not
accumulate — folding fame straight into the tier makes almost every late-game
reception a gang and erases the ladder.

Because it lives in threat.ts, `npm run campaign` scores the same function
the game uses; it reports the tier mix and whether threat actually tracks
wealth. The escape valve is `jettisonCargo()`: pirates came for cargo, so
dumping enough of it satisfies them (`NpcShip.satisfied`, which
`isHostileToPlayer` respects).

### 7. The galaxy keeps trading while you're elsewhere

`galaxy/living.ts` is a **level-1 simulation**: convoys between systems are
*records*, not objects, advanced in whole days whenever the player's clock
moves (a jump costs days). Convoys depart in proportion to productivity,
are lost to piracy in proportion to lawlessness, and on arrival nudge the
destination's prices. Systems accumulate `danger`, which raises pirate
spawns when you're there — so hotspots emerge along genuinely dangerous
routes rather than being scripted.

The 1984 seeded galaxy remains the **baseline**: this layer stores only
deltas (±25% price pressure, danger, convoys in flight), lives in the
commander's save as `galaxyState`, and decays back toward baseline when
trade stops. Level 2 is the existing NPC spawning: `populateSystem` asks
the living galaxy what's arriving and materialises those convoys as real
ships.

## Conventions & gotchas checklist

- **Money** is integer *tenths of a credit* everywhere (`1000` = 100.0 Cr).
  `formatCredits()` renders it. **Fuel** is tenths of a light-year (max 70).
- **Forward is −Z**; pitch rotates about local X, roll about local Z; "nose
  up" = rotate +X. The player and every ship use rate-ramped "keyboard
  analogue" steering (see `player.ts`).
- **Distances on the chart**: `4·sqrt(dx² + (dy/2)²)` in tenths of a LY —
  the original's asymmetric formula; chart Y is drawn half-scale.
- **Saves**: one record, one key, one `setItem` — a `WorldSnapshot` plus the
  name it was saved under (`save-file.ts`). Three kinds, and the id shape is
  what keeps them apart: `save:file:<NAME>` is a save the player named,
  `save:auto:<CAREER>:dock` is the checkpoint written on docking and again
  immediately before launch, and `save:auto:<CAREER>:fly:<0..2>` is the ring
  `autoSave()` fills every 20 seconds of flight. An autosave cannot overwrite a
  named save because a typed name cannot produce an `auto:` id. `<CAREER>` is
  which COMMANDER a save belongs to — the name they were asked for when they
  were started, which is why nothing generates one and nothing renames one
  (`save-file.ts`; the word is invariant 3's and no player reads it). `<ns>boot`
  says which record the next boot resumes, or `new:<NAME>` when it is a
  commander who does not have one yet; docking and dying drop the ring, never the
  checkpoint. docs/INVARIANTS.md invariant 3 is the whole rule.
- **Debug handles** (deliberate, documented): `window.__game` (a
  `legacyHandles(Game)` console view — used by the autopilot test harness, see
  docs/JAMESON-TRIALS.md), `window.__policyKit` (trained brains + inference
  fns), `state.brains.scripted` (disable brains), `state.cheat`
  (buy any equipment free, any tech level), `state.brains.pack`
  (switch pirates to the 18-input pack brain — off by default, and see
  docs/TRAINING-LOG.md for why).
- **Determinism**: everything is seeded (mulberry32) and `Math.random` is
  banned in world code — `game/rng.ts` is the world's only stream, and
  `makeRng()` beside it hands a harness a private one. A training episode
  reseeds the world from its own seed, so episodes must be run one at a time
  rather than interleaved. Episode seeds are deterministic per generation and
  mutation noise comes from a seeded RNG, so a full training rerun produces
  byte-identical weights on the same CLI args (verified: two runs, same
  generation curve, same brain).
- The **help panel** (`?` in-game), the manual page and the docked menu are
  **rendered** from `BINDINGS` + `COMMAND_HELP` by `ui/key-help.ts`, so a key
  changes in one place: `engine/keymap.ts` for the flight axes, `controls.ts`
  plus `command-help.ts` for everything else. The README is the only hand-
  written surface left, and `test/key-help.test.ts` holds it to the table in
  both directions (docs/INVARIANTS.md invariant 9, docs/TODO/50).

## Where to start reading, in order

1. `galaxy/galaxy.ts` — self-contained, delightful, 250 lines.
2. `ships/elite-a-hulls.ts` → `ships/elite-a-faces.ts` — the data-as-art bit.
3. `player.ts` then `game/npc.ts` — flight, then behaviours.
4. `game/game.ts` — top to bottom once, with the mode machine in mind.
5. `ai-training/policy.ts` → `ai-training/scenario.ts` → `train/evolve.ts` — the AI stack
   (then docs/AI-TRAINING.md and docs/TRAINING-LOG.md for the results).
