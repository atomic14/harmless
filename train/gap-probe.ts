//
// Chris, having flown it: *"I think one thing I'm observing they fly quite far
// before turning for another run."* That is a complaint about a CLOCK, and none
// of the three probes beside this one can see it.
//
//   `train/flight-probe.ts`  counts passes per episode for ONE pirate, which is
//                            a rate over a whole fight and says nothing about
//                            the spacing between two of them.
//   `train/ram-probe.ts`     counts contact for FIVE, which is the failure mode
//                            a shorter cycle risks, not the cycle itself.
//
// So this is the third question, and it is docs/TODO/67's: from the moment a
// ship merges to the moment it merges again, how many seconds does the player
// spend watching it fly away? A merge is the ship coming inside
// `BREAK_OFF_RANGE` — the game's own number for "this is knife range now", read
// from break-off.ts rather than re-picked, so the tool cannot come to mean
// something the flight model does not.
//
// TWO numbers, because one of them alone is a trap:
//
//   gap    seconds between consecutive merges by the SAME ship. This is the
//          rhythm the player feels.
//   apex   how far out it got in between. A gap can be shortened by a ship that
//          simply flies slower, and the apex is what says whether the run got
//          shorter or the ship got lazier. It is also the reading that catches
//          the failure the whole cycle exists to avoid: a ship that stops
//          leaving at all has a very short gap and is a turret.
//
// FIVE pirates and a holding target, which is `train/ram-probe.ts`'s wave shape
// rather than flight-probe's duel, because the rhythm the complaint is about is
// the one a gang produces. The target is UNARMED for both probes' reason: it
// keeps all five alive for the whole episode, so every run measures the same
// amount of flying.
//
// Per SHIP, not per fight. Five pirates that merge in turn produce a merge
// every two seconds between them and each still takes nine to come round, and
// the second number is the one the player is watching.
