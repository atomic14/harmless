// CLAUDE.md states the problem this exists for, and it is the one thing every
// score in this project is blind to:
//
//   > A well-optimised pirate is a turret that hangs in space and snipes, and
//   > evolution will find it. We want a dogfight the player can win — attack
//   > runs, weaving, overshoots. Lethality is a proxy for threat, and a brain
//   > that wins every measurement can still be the wrong brain.
//
// Generations 1 and 2 won every measurement in docs/TRAINING-LOG.md and were
// rolled back the day they shipped, because stopping really IS the optimal way
// to hold a firing line. The tournament could not see it. This can:
//
//   speed        a turret cruises slowly. Pirate hulls have a floor
//                (MIN_CRUISE_FRACTION) so it cannot stop dead any more, but it
//                can still sit at the floor and pivot.
//   passes       an attack run is a closure and a break. Counted as a
//                hysteresis crossing — in past PASS_CLOSE, out past PASS_FAR —
//                so a ship loitering at 600 units scores none however long it
//                stays.
//   range spread the p10-to-p90 gap. An attack run sweeps through it; a turret
//                holds one range and the spread collapses.
//   on-six       time spent astern of the target AND pointed at it, which is
//                the manoeuvre that is actually threatening.
//   rams         contact per episode, against an UNARMED target so that every
//                point the pirate loses is something it flew into. Threat is
//                not "flew into you".
//
// NONE OF THESE IS A GATE. They are a description, for a human deciding whether
// to promote a brain, and the decision is made by flying it — `T` at any
// station, see docs/BROWSER-TRIALS.md.
//
// ## It does not do its own arithmetic any more (TODO 34)
//
// The three measurements above that a pilot also sees in the game — their
// speed, the range spread they held and the passes they made — are now taken by
// `CombatSimRecorder` itself: this file builds a recorder per episode, feeds it
// the fight, and reads `report().opposition`. So the tool and the combat
// trainer's report cannot disagree about what a pass is, because there is one
// `countPasses` and one `PASS_CLOSE`/`PASS_FAR` and they live in
// `src/game/combat-sim-report.ts` beside `SIX_CONE` and `SAMPLE_HZ`, each with
// the reason it is the measurement's own number. This file used to hold a
// second copy of all three, which is one rule with two homes — the failure
// CLAUDE.md is organised against — waiting for somebody to move one of them.
//
// The one thing that IS this file's own is the CADENCE. The trainer samples at
// SAMPLE_HZ because a twenty-minute sparring session at 60 Hz is a lot of
// arithmetic nobody reads; a batch of 45-second episodes can afford every step,
// and sampling every step is what the archived probe rows
// (train/logs/todo32/flight-probe.txt) were taken at. It is declared through
// the recorder's own `sampleHz`, so every duration the recorder derives still
// agrees with the clock — not a second cadence bolted on the side.
