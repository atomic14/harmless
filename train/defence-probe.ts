// Is the defender surviving, or is it just running away? — the shape of a
// defence policy's fight, broken down by what made it hard.
//
//   node --experimental-strip-types train/defence-probe.ts [episodes] [brain...]
//
// The pair to `flight-probe.ts`, which asks the same question of an ATTACKER.
// This one is for a TRAINED defence candidate — and since 2026-08-05 nothing
// trained ships: armed traders and the combat computer fly hand-written code
// under the one name `attack-run` (src/game/brain-names.ts), and the
// `jameson-defend` line this tool was built to probe is retired. Run with a
// candidate's stem to probe it; with no names it says so rather than probing
// a file that is not there. It exists because two numbers were hiding a third.
//
// ## Why a breakdown rather than an average
//
// `npm run train -- defend` reports one figure — the fraction of the
// commander's pools left, averaged over the validation seeds — and champions
// are chosen on it. Averaged, `jameson-defend-g1` reads about 76%, and two
// retrained policies read 72-75%, so the retrains looked worse and the obvious
// conclusion was that they needed more search.
//
// Broken down, over 400 held-out episodes (2026-08-03, and see the note below —
// these were measured in a world where the commander's pools never came back):
//
//   by pirate count     pools left      pirates killed
//     1                    91.4%             10.2%
//     2                    81.8%              5.4%
//     3                    72.9%              6.8%
//     4                    60.6%             10.5%
//
//   by hull flown
//     playerCobra          76.1%              7.5%
//     playerCobraSlow      77.0%              4.9%
//     traderCobra          76.6%             12.4%
//
// The count is a real gradient. The hull moves the kill rate by 2.5x and moves
// pools-left by nothing at all — so the metric the champion is chosen on cannot
// see it, and widening the training distribution along that axis added search
// space the selector is blind to. That is docs/TODO/65, and this tool is how it
// was found and how a fix is judged.
//
// ## What the columns mean
//
//   pools left     the commander's three 255-point pools at the end, as a
//                  fraction of what they started at — `Episode.trader.hp`.
//   died           episodes the defender did not survive. It saturated at 0/240
//                  for every policy until docs/TODO/62 put missiles in the sky;
//                  it is 4 to 6 now, and it is the one thing the outcome will
//                  not trade for anything.
//   broke          the share of the attacking force's energy banks she took off
//                  them — `Episode.attackerDamageShare()`, and 40% of the
//                  outcome `evolve.ts` selects on since docs/TODO/65.
//   killed         the share of attacking pirates destroyed: the same quantity
//                  as `broke` with the granularity thrown away, kept because it
//                  is the number a human judges a fight by.
//
// TWO OF THESE ARE NOW THE SELECTION METRIC, and until docs/TODO/65 only the
// first was: a champion was chosen by terminal `hp` alone, at 1000x, with the
// shaped fitness clamped so hard it contributed 1.9% of the score. Killing was
// rational only if it cost less than 0.30% of her pools, so the selector
// preferred a policy that never fired — `jameson-defend-t62` fired ZERO shots
// across 240 of these episodes and still outranked the shipped brain. The
// outcome is `0.6 x pools kept + 0.4 x broke` now, cumulative rather than
// terminal, and zero if she dies; `train/selection.ts` is the rule and
// `test/selection.test.ts` asserts the ordering it exists to produce.
//
// ## The numbers above are on the OLD baseline
//
// docs/TODO/63 gave the target `systems.ts`'s `regenerate` — the same call the
// game makes for the commander every frame — so pools-left now measures recovery
// as well as avoidance, and a figure from before 2026-08-04 is not comparable
// with one from after it. They are kept because they are what was measured and
// what docs/TODO/65 was found from; re-run the tool for a current one.
//
// ## The fight it flies
//
// `train/defence-fight.ts`, which `train/evolve.ts` builds the phase's episodes
// from — the same function rather than the same four lines, so this tool cannot
// come to measure a distribution nothing was fitted to. 1 to 4 pirates, one of
// three hulls, beam or military laser, with or without the extra energy unit,
// against the SCRIPTED attack run that every pirate flies since d563e3d. Held-out
// seed bases by default — never `evolve.ts`'s validation base, because a policy
// is selected on that one and quoting it back is asking a brain how it did on
// its own exam.
