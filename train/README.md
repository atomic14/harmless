# Reproducing the AI training runs

Everything here runs in plain Node (≥ 22.6, for `--experimental-strip-types`),
and the trainer imports **the game itself** — `NpcShip`, `PlayerShip`,
`gunnery.ts`, `collisions.ts`, `rng.ts`, stepped at the game's own `FIXED_DT`.
three.js is the only dependency and it runs headless; there is no canvas and
no WebGL anywhere in a training run.

The trainer imports **the game itself**; there is no second physics. So **a
change to a combat number is a change to the training environment**, and the
shipped brains are stale the moment you touch `NPC_COOLDOWN_LO`, `IMPACT.ram`,
a hull's energy bank or the player's flight envelope. Nothing can silently
drift, and nothing is free either.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install                       # only needed for the game/viewer, not training
npm run train -- attack           # ~4 min on one laptop core
npm run train -- evade            # an unarmed trader vs the scripted pirate
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings train/evaluate.ts 40
```

Each run prints per-generation `best / mean / scripted-ref` fitness, appends
a JSONL curve to `train/logs/`, and writes the winning brain to
`src/ai-training/brains/<name>.json` (with its hyperparameters and score in `meta`).

> **Always pass `--validate-select`.** Without it the final brain is chosen by
> comparing scores across generations that used different episode seeds, which
> picks the luckiest generation rather than the best genome.
>
> **Footgun warning:** a run WRITES a weights file into
> `src/ai-training/brains/`, which ships empty apart from a `.gitkeep` —
> `git checkout src/ai-training/brains` clears whatever a run left behind. The
> game itself imports NO weights: it flies three hand-written code pilots, so
> which brains it flies is decided in `src/game/brain-names.ts` —
> `SHIPPED_BRAINS` is the one line that changes a default — and
> `src/game/brains.ts` is where a name would turn into loaded weights if any were
> imported. `npm test` holds the weights directory to exactly what `brains.ts`
> imports (today: nothing), so the regression gate cannot end up measuring a
> brain nobody flies.

## The five phases

| phase | trains | against | command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `attack` | a pirate | scripted trader | `npm run train -- attack --gens 400 --pop 64 --eps 3` |
| `evade` | an unarmed trader | scripted pirate (`--opponent` for a trained one) | `npm run train -- evade --gens 400 --pop 64 --eps 3` |
| league | a pirate again | a trained evader | `npm run train -- attack --opponent <an evade brain> --out my-brain --gens 300 --pop 48` (add `--seed-brain <a champion you kept>` to continue a line) |
| `pack` | 3 shared-brain pirates | armed scripted trader | `npm run train -- pack --gens 300 --pop 48` |
| `defend` | an ARMED trader ("Jameson") | 2× `scripted`, the default opponent (`--opponent` overrides it) | `npm run train -- defend --gens 300 --pop 48` |

A league or `evade` run needs a frozen opponent, named one of two ways: the
special name `scripted` (the hand-written attack run — it loads no file, and is
the default for `evade` and `defend`), or the stem of a weights file you trained
yourself. The tree ships NO weights files — the game flies three code pilots
(TODO 57) — so for a TRAINED opponent, train it first and point `--opponent` at
it. `--out` defaults to the phase's default name, so a run without `--out`
writes that file into the otherwise-empty directory — `git checkout
src/ai-training/brains` clears it.

Flags: `--gens --pop --eps --elites` (numbers), `--opponent <brain-name>`
(loads `src/ai-training/brains/<name>.json` as the frozen opponent),
`--seed-brain <name>` (start the population from a previous champion —
league play), `--out <name>` (output brain name).

## How to tell it worked (don't trust the training fitness)

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings train/evaluate.ts 40
```

runs the tournament on **held-out seeds** (base 10,000,019 — training seeds
never exceed ~400k), against a scripted-AI upper bound and a random-policy
floor, reporting kill rate / time-to-kill / accuracy / survival / losses /
flanking spread per matchup. The numbers we shipped against are recorded in
[docs/TRAINING-LOG.md](../docs/TRAINING-LOG.md); the raw table for the
current brains is `train/logs/tournament-final.txt`.

The whole trainer is seeded and single-threaded, so a rerun with identical
CLI args is bit-identical on the same Node build and platform — verified by
running the same command twice and diffing both the generation curve and the
saved weights. Note the single-threaded part is now load-bearing rather than
incidental: an episode reseeds the world's own PRNG (`game/rng.ts`), so
episodes have to be run one at a time and not interleaved. Across
platforms expect small numeric drift (Math.tanh/acos aren't spec-mandated to
be correctly rounded) — judge against the reference columns rather than
demanding exact equality there.

## Wiring a new brain into the game

**`src/ai-training/brains/` ships EMPTY — just a `.gitkeep`. The game flies
three hand-written code pilots (`attack-run`, `pursuit`, `scripted`) and
`brains.ts` imports no weights, so `npm test` asserts the weights directory
matches exactly what `brains.ts` imports (today: nothing) — it trips the moment
a `.json` appears that `brains.ts` doesn't import, or a file it imports goes
missing** (TODO 57). So a candidate is either being compared or being promoted,
and the two are different amounts of work:

*To COMPARE it* — no game changes at all:

1. Train it (`--out my-brain`), which leaves the weights in the directory.
2. Add the stem to `CANDIDATES` in `train/evaluate.ts`. Every solo, pack and
   defence table it belongs in grows a row, and so does the flight probe.
3. `npm run evaluate`, and fly it: the combat trainer at `T` needs step 4 below,
   so until then the honest comparison is the tournament plus the probe.
4. Delete it or promote it. The guard will report the extra file until you do —
   that is the decision it exists to force.

*To PROMOTE it* — now the game has to be able to fly it:

5. Import it where the incumbents are imported: `src/game/brains.ts` (one
   `brainFromFile` block and one line in `LOADED`). Any observation width
   works — 13, 17 or 25 (plus 29 for defence); `npc.ts` picks the widest encoder
   the brain has inputs for. The combat viewer's rows ask `brains.ts` for the shipped policy by role,
   so `src/viewer/main.ts` needs nothing unless you want a row of its own.
6. Name it in `src/game/brain-names.ts`: one `BrainName`, one row in
   `SELECTIONS` (and a `BrainSelection` flag if it is an alternative rather than
   a replacement), one line in the rule, and one entry in `BRAINS` — the two or
   three words a pilot picks it by (`HOLDS OFF`) beside the measured line they
   compress (`A GANG THAT WATCHES ITS FLEET AND HOLDS OFF — MEDIAN RANGE 1447
   …`). Both, or `npm test` fails: a brain the picker offers with no name is a
   filename on the row, and one with no line is a claim with no probe behind it.
   That is what makes it pickable in both places and reportable by name — the
   combat trainer's `SIM_BRAINS` list is derived from it.
7. If it REPLACES an incumbent, delete the incumbent's weights: the directory
   guard is what keeps "what ships" and "what is in the bundle" the same set.
8. `npm run build` bundles the JSON weights (~15 KB gzipped each).

In-game A/B: brain selection is STATE, not a global — `state.brains`
(`BrainSelection` in `src/game/brain-names.ts`). Two ways in, and neither is a
flag: the **LIVE BRAINS (CAREER)** row on the combat trainer's setup panel (`T`
at any station) picks one policy for the whole galaxy, and from a console the
one documented handle does the same — `__game.state.brains.scripted = true`
reverts the WHOLE game to the hand-written attack run (pirates and the defence
co-pilot both), and `__game.state.brains.pursuit = true` names the pursuit
dogfighter the pirates already fly by default (so it changes nothing unless a
`scripted` career is being switched back). Those two are the whole of
`BrainSelection`. A save carrying an older flag still loads and flies the
shipped brains. It is in the snapshot, so a reload keeps flying what you chose.

## The Jameson autopilot (end-to-end economy test)

The trade-run experiment from docs/JAMESON-TRIALS.md is a browser-console
harness: it drives the *real game* through `window.__game` and flies combat
through `window.__policyKit`. See `train/jameson-autopilot.js` — paste it
into the DevTools console with the game open, then:

```js
await __auto.runTrial('Lave', 'Leesti', 6)   // 6 legs, prints the ledger
```

It calls `useHarnessSaves()` first, which moves the whole page — the running
game's autosave included — into a scratch namespace for the life of the tab.
Nothing it does can reach a real save, and nothing puts the namespace back:
reload the page to play your career. (A backup-and-restore in a `finally` is not
enough on its own: the world autosaves every 20 seconds, so a tab left running
overwrites the restore.)
