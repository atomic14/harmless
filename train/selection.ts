// WHAT A CHAMPION IS CHOSEN BY — the selection rule, in one file.
//
// `train/evolve.ts` runs the search; this says which genome comes out of it. It
// is a separate file for the same reason `train/defence-fight.ts` is: the rule
// has to be assertable. It was two expressions inside a script that parses argv
// and trains on import, so nothing could ask it a question, and the answer to
// "does a defender that fights outrank one that does not" was found by reading
// arithmetic rather than by running it. `test/selection.test.ts` runs it now, on
// two hand-built genomes.
//
// ## The rule, in one line
//
//   score = 0.75 x outcome(0..1) + 0.25 x shaped/full-scale(0..1)
//
// Both terms are fractions of a stated whole, so THE RATIO IS STATED: the
// outcome owns three quarters of the score and the shaping term can move a
// genome by at most a quarter, whatever the phase's fitness function happens to
// be scaled in.
//
// It was `win * 1000 + clamp(shaped, ±499)`, and the clamp was written so that
// shaping could break ties "within an outcome band rather than ever outranking a
// better outcome". It does that — and real shaped values come out between 8 and
// 19 against a bound of 499, so the shaping term contributed 1.9% of the score
// and the tie-break never fired (docs/TODO/65). A ±499 clamp on a quantity that
// ranges 8-19 is not a policy about how much shaping should count; it is an
// accident of scale, and this file replaces it with a decision.
//
// ## What "won" means, per phase, and why the two sides differ
//
// The polarity trap first, because it has cost four retrains and the warning
// belongs wherever `outcomeOf` lives: in `evade` and `defend` THE GENOME IS THE
// TRADER, so the trader dying is a FAILURE. Scoring every phase by damage done
// to the trader selected the evader and the defender that died most often —
// trader-evade fell from 14.44 to 2.09 and jameson-defend from 22.43 to 1.34
// across four retrains before anyone spotted it, and the physics was blamed
// first. Any change here needs that scepticism, including this one.
//
//   attack, pack   the share of the target's pools TAKEN OFF THE COMMANDER
//                  (`targetDamageShare`) — unchanged, and cumulative since
//                  docs/TODO/63 gave the commander a recharge.
//   evade          the share the commander KEPT, zero if they died. Getting
//                  away untouched is the whole job of an evader, so there is
//                  deliberately no fighting term here — see below.
//   defend         the share the commander kept AND the share of the attacking
//                  force they broke. Surviving is necessary and not sufficient:
//                  a commander fits the combat computer to help them FIGHT, not
//                  to fly them away, and a policy that survives by never being
//                  in the fight
//                  must not be able to top the table.
//
// ## Why the defender's outcome is not terminal `hp`
//
// It was `ep.trader.hp` — their pools at the final frame — and that quantity has
// two defects, one of which arrived with docs/TODO/63:
//
//   - **Shooting was worth almost nothing.** At 1000x for the outcome and a
//     shaping term worth 1.9% of the score, killing an entire pirate paid 3
//     points where 1% of their pools paid 10. Killing was rational only if the
//     engagement cost less than 0.30% of their pools, which it never does, so a
//     policy that flew away outranked every policy that fought. `jameson-defend-
//     t62` fired ZERO shots across 240 held-out fights and still outranked the
//     shipped brain on this metric.
//   - **Finishing was worth less than dawdling.** With the pools recharging,
//     terminal `hp` is close to "how long since the commander was last hit". A pilot that
//     CLEARS the fight ends the episode early and heals for less of the clock,
//     so it reads lower however well it flew. Measured: a hand-built turret that
//     kills 75.7% of its attackers and clears 15 of 24 fights takes the LEAST
//     cumulative damage of any pilot tried (247 points against a runner's 272)
//     and ends with the LOWEST terminal `hp` of the five (86.9% against 89.7%).
//
// `1 - targetDamageShare()` is the same quantity with neither defect: cumulative
// points taken off the commander, over their own pools, which is what `Episode` already
// gives the attack and pack phases from the other side.
//
// ## The ratio, in the units docs/TODO/65 stated the defect in
//
// Against two attackers, with `DEFENCE_POOLS_KEPT` at 0.6 and
// `DEFENCE_ATTACKERS_BROKEN` at 0.4:
//
//   | | worth at selection | was |
//   |---|---|---|
//   | 1% of their pools | 0.0045 | 10 points |
//   | destroying one of two attackers | 0.15, plus the shaping | 3 points |
//
// So destroying one of two attackers is worth about a THIRD of their pools, where
// it used to be worth 0.3% of them. That is the deliberate statement, and it is
// deliberate in this direction: a dead attacker stops shooting for the rest of
// the fight, and their pools come back while it does not. Trading a third of
// their shields to halve the incoming fire is a good trade and the rule should say so.
//
// Erasable-TypeScript only — runs in Node via --experimental-strip-types.
