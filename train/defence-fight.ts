// WHAT A DEFENDER MEETS, and what it is flying when it meets it.
//
// One seed in, one fight out. `train/evolve.ts` builds the defend phase's
// episodes from this, and `train/defence-probe.ts` measures a policy over the
// same derivation on held-out seeds — which only means anything if the two agree
// exactly. They used to be two copies of the same four lines, each with a
// comment telling the next person to keep them in step by hand; adding a fourth
// axis to that was going to be the run where they quietly stopped agreeing and
// the probe reported on a distribution nothing was fitted to.
//
// Chris: "we should train against all the different scenarios and ships. Let's
// make sure our combat computer sees everything that could be thrown at it."
//
// `jameson-defend-g1` and the first g2 both trained against EXACTLY two pirates
// flying at EXACTLY one hull, so what they were fitted for was a single scenario
// repeated with different dice. The game does not do that: a wave is one ship or
// six, the tiers climb, and the same policy flies the combat computer in
// whatever the commander happens to be sitting in.
