// The two stations: released geometry, at a size Harmless chose.
//
// Both hulls are exact — the Coriolis is design 1 and the Dodo design 0, read
// out of the same generated catalogue as every ship — and both are drawn FOUR
// TIMES the one geometry conversion. That factor is the only per-object scale
// in the project and it is OURS, not a source value:
//
//     STATION_PRESENTATION_SCALE = 4
//
// Why it exists. `sourceGeometryToWorld` puts one world unit at four source
// units, anchored on the Cobra Mk III, and through it the released Coriolis is
// 40 world units across the half-diagonal — 1.7 Cobras wide. The Harmless scene
// has always placed a 160-unit station, 4.7 Cobras wide, and `game/docking.ts`
// is built on that width: the approach gate is five station half-widths out,
// the launch standoff and the Vipers' stack are absolute distances, and the
// slot channel is a tolerance in world units. Shrinking the station fourfold
// would move all of them at once and turn a 900-unit approach into a 225-unit
// one, which is a docking change and not a geometry one. So the SHAPE is the
// released table and the SIZE is the scene's: a station is drawn at one world
// unit per source unit, which is where the familiar 160 comes from.
//
// Nothing else may reach for this. A hull that looks wrong at the ship scale is
// wrong in the source or wrong in the scene; this is not a knob, it is one
// stated decision about two objects, and this file is where it is stated.

 * AN EXPRESSION, not a coincidence: it was a second `4` whose comment said "4
 * is exactly the factor that cancels the conversion" in English while nothing
 * enforced it. Written this way, a station is 1:1 with its source units — 160
 * for the Coriolis, 196 for the Dodo — whatever the ship conversion becomes,
 * which is what every absolute docking distance above is built on. It cannot
 * live in src/constants/ because its meaning IS this product over the ships'
 * own anchor, which that directory may not import — the
 * `WORLD_SPEED_PER_SOURCE_SPEED` shape (docs/TODO/completed/90-constants-cleanup.md).
