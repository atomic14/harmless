// How a hull becomes a mesh — the contract and the two builders, and nothing
// else.
//
// Ships are drawn the way the 1984 originals were defined: explicit vertex and
// edge lists. So the wireframes stay clean, with no triangulation diagonals.
// The faces are filled matte black underneath the edges. That is the classic
// "hidden line" look — a hull occludes whatever is behind it, including its own
// far side.
//
// THE HULLS THEMSELVES LIVE ELSEWHERE. This file used to hold twenty-odd
// hand-written approximations of the Elite ships, and every one of them is
// gone. The released tables are exact and generated.
// `ships/elite-a-hulls.ts` turns them into a `ShipDef`, and
// `ships/registry.ts` is how anything asks for one.
// What is left here is the format they all share. `ships/harmless-hulls.ts`
// holds the shapes that are ours and have no source record.

 * hand-written ship here was, so nothing that existed before changes shape.

 *
 *   - the Transporter, the Thargoid and the Thargon;
 *   - the escape pod and the alloy plate;
 *   - the boulder, the asteroid and the splinter.
 *
 * For those, a mirror is a different ship. A
 * rotation is what "point the nose the other way" actually means, so that is
 * what the builder does. See docs/INVARIANTS.md invariant 7.
