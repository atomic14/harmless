// Closed polygons, worked back out of the source's face/edge adjacency.
//
// The released tables never stored a polygon. A face is a normal and a
// visibility distance; an edge says which two faces it lies BETWEEN. That was
// enough for the original renderer, which drew lines and hid them with a
// per-face facing test, and it is not enough for Harmless, which fills the hull
// matte black under the wireframe so a ship occludes what is behind it. So the
// boundary of each face has to be reconstructed, and this is the only place
// that happens.
//
// Three passes, narrowing:
//
//   1. BOUNDARY. A face's boundary is the edges that name it on exactly one
//      side. Some of those are decorative spurs — the Cobra's nose laser is an
//      edge given two real face ids purely so it disappears with them — so
//      dangling ends are pruned until every vertex has two neighbours, and the
//      result must be one cycle covering every remaining edge.
//   2. COPLANAR MERGE. A flat back split into several faces with the SAME
//      normal has no closed boundary of its own: the Adder's rear hexagon is
//      three faces contributing two edges each. Faces that failed pass 1 and
//      share a normal are retried as one region.
//   3. WHOLE HULL. A design whose face is named by no edge at all — the alloy
//      plate, one face and four edges that all say "no face" — is a single
//      polygon, so its own edge cycle is the loop.
//
// Nothing is dropped quietly. A face that survives all three unresolved is
// REPORTED, as are the edges that end up in no loop and the faces whose stored
// normal disagrees with the polygon that was found. `test/geometry.test.ts`
// reads those reports and pins the counts, so a re-import that changed the
// topology could not slip past as "it still renders".
