// The shapes that are OURS — no source record, and labelled so.
//
// Everything the released catalogue supplies is generated and exact
// (`ships/elite-a-hulls.ts`). What is in here is not, and the separation is a
// requirement rather than a courtesy. The generation ship is a Harmless
// encounter, and must never be presented as a recovered Elite-A design. Their
// ids live in `game/ship-identity.ts` under `harmless:`, which is the same
// bargain from the other end.
//
// THE STATIONS USED TO BE HERE, and they are not any more. They are exact
// released hulls now, drawn at a size Harmless chose — the one per-object scale
// in the project, and `ships/station-hulls.ts` states it. What is left in this
// file has no source record at all, which is the only thing that belongs here.
