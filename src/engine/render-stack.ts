// Pulled out of Game's constructor because it is the one thing keeping the
// game from being constructed without a browser. Every rule the world step
// needs now lives in a module that imports nothing but maths — three.js itself
// runs happily under node, with no canvas and no WebGL, and the tests prove it
// by building hulls and firing rays at them. What does NOT run headless is
// WebGLRenderer, and this is where it is confined.
//
// Keeping the beams here is deliberate: they are children of the camera, so
// they belong to whatever owns the camera.
