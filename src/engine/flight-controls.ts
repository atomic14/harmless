// The human's hands, turned into a FlightDemand.
//
// This is the other half of the seam player.ts opens. It is a PURE function
// from "what is held down" to "what the pilot wants". So the same ship flies
// for a person, a policy and a replay.
//
// It reads no globals. It mutates nothing. It runs under node. That is why a
// test can finally assert the ramp it applies against the model, rather than
// read it in a comment.
//
// The ramp lives HERE rather than in the ship, because the ramp belongs to the
// pilot. This one is the classic keyboard-analogue feel: RATE_RAMP up,
// RATE_DECAY down, capped at MAX_ROLL/MAX_PITCH. The combat computer's is
// deliberately a different one. See FlightDemand.
//
// Mouse DECAY is not done here: `decayMouse` mutates the Input, and a pure
// producer must not. The caller does it, immediately after reading — see
// Game.pilotDemand.
