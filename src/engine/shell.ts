// The shell: everything the game needs from the machine it is running on.
//
// This is the seam a desktop port would reimplement, and it is deliberately
// small — the whole interface is below, on one screen, the same bargain as
// `StepHost` and `SimHost`. (It said "seven members" while it had nine; a
// count of the thing directly underneath it is a claim with nothing to gain.)
// The Game asks for a shell, not for a browser, so `game.ts` names no DOM API
// at all.
//
// Before this existed, `game.ts` was 1,757 lines of which ELEVEN mentioned the
// browser: a canvas in the constructor, a resize listener, a click listener,
// the rAF loop, a CSS custom property, and two `getElementById` calls. Those
// eleven lines made the whole file unportable AND unconstructible under node,
// which is why the largest file in the project had zero test coverage. A thin
// shell was welded to the orchestrator and both were stuck.
//
// `browser-shell.ts` is the real one. `headlessShell()` at the bottom of this
// file is the other one, and it is not a stub for tests to tolerate: it is the
// proof the seam is real, because a Game built on it runs the actual game loop
// with no DOM in the process.
