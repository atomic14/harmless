// The shell: everything the game needs from the machine under it.
//
// This is the seam a desktop port would reimplement, and it is deliberately
// small. The whole interface is below, on one screen. That is the same bargain
// as `StepHost` and `SimHost`.
//
// (It said "seven members" while it had nine. A count of the thing directly
// underneath it is a claim with nothing to gain.)
//
// The Game asks for a shell, not for a browser. So `game.ts` names no DOM API
// at all.
//
// Before this existed, `game.ts` was 1,757 lines. ELEVEN of them mentioned the
// browser:
//
//   - a canvas in the constructor;
//   - a resize listener;
//   - a click listener;
//   - the rAF loop;
//   - a CSS custom property;
//   - two `getElementById` calls.
//
// Those eleven lines made the whole file unportable AND unconstructible under
// node. That is why the largest file in the project had zero test coverage. A
// thin shell was welded to the orchestrator, and both were stuck.
//
// `browser-shell.ts` is the real one. `headlessShell()` at the bottom of this
// file is the other one, and it is not a stub for a test to tolerate. It is the
// proof that the seam is real: a Game built on it runs the actual game loop,
// with no DOM in the process.
