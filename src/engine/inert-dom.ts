// A DOM element that accepts every write and performs none of them.
//
// The painters — hud.ts, tunnel.ts — cache elements in field initializers, so a
// single `document.getElementById` in any of them made the whole `Game`
// unconstructible under node. That is why the largest file in the project had
// zero test coverage: not because the orchestrator needed a browser, but
// because three of its fields did.
//
// The bargain is the same one game/storage.ts makes with localStorage and
// world/corona-texture.ts makes with canvas: code that knows about the platform is
// the code that copes with the platform being absent. None of what a painter
// does has to SUCCEED for the game to be correct — the HUD is a dumb painter
// (docs/INVARIANTS.md invariant 15) and nothing reads it back — it only has to not throw.
//
// This is emphatically not a DOM implementation. If a rule ever depends on what
// one of these returns, that rule is in the wrong file.
