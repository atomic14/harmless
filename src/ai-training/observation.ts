// WHAT A POLICY SEES — the four observation encoders, and the choice between
// them.
//
// One question per encoder, and every answer is in the OBSERVER'S ship frame,
// so a policy is position- and orientation-invariant:
//
//   observe          13  a lone fighter and its target
//   observeDefend    29  ...plus how hurt we are, the warhead, the threat's
//                        velocity, the SECOND threat and the shield split
//                        (docs/TODO/71, /72, /91)
//   observePack      17  ...plus where the nearest wingman is
//   observePackWide  25  ...plus what that wingman is DOING
//
// A separate file from `policy.ts`: that file is the NETWORK and the GENOME —
// what shape a brain is, how a forward pass runs, how a genome mutates and
// widens — and this one is what fills the input vector. The two meet in exactly
// two places: `ShipView`, which is what a caller fills in, and `observeFor`,
// which is the one home for turning a brain's declared input count into an
// encoder. Make that choice twice and the trainer can produce a genome the game
// cannot fly — it has happened twice.
//
// The vector helpers are this file's own arithmetic, NOT a second physics: they
// are structural (V3 is `{x,y,z}`) on purpose — the encoders are handed
// THREE.Vector3s by the game and plain objects by a harness, and must read both
// without converting or allocating a scene graph to ask where a ship is pointing.
//
// Erasable-TypeScript only — runs in Node via --experimental-strip-types.
