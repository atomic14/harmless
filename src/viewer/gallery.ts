// Every released design on one screen — the dev tool for looking at geometry.
//
// It exists because "the hull is right" is not something a test can tell you.
// The counts, the closed loops and the winding are asserted in
// `test/geometry.test.ts`; whether the Ghavial looks like a Ghavial, whether a
// hull occludes its own far side, and whether the target radius is a sane sphere
// around the ship are things you have to see. So: all thirty-eight, labelled,
// at either their true relative sizes or normalised to a common one, each inside
// a wireframe sphere at its catalogue target radius.
//
// Keyboard-driven and deliberately plain. It is not part of the game bundle —
// gallery.html is its own Vite entry — and nothing in `src/game` imports it. The
// keys are gallery-main.ts's, beside the page they drive; they used to be in the
// combat viewer's handler behind a `G` toggle, which is why `/viewer` opened on
// this grid.
