// The canvas, the camera and the bloom — the part both dev pages share.
//
// There are two of them now (TODO 57): `/viewer` is the combat viewer and
// `/gallery` is the 38 released hulls. They used to be one page with a `G` key
// between them, which meant `/viewer` opened on the gallery with a combat
// dropdown underneath it and the combat viewer read as deleted.
//
// What they genuinely share is the scaffolding: a WebGL context, a bloom pass at
// one strength, a starfield and a resize handler. That is here so there is one
// answer to "what does a dev page look like" rather than two that drift — and it
// is ALL that is here. Neither page's controls, HUD or keys live in this file;
// each owns its own, which is the whole point of the split.
