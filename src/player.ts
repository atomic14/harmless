// The player's flight model, and the language it is flown in.
//
// Elite-style flight: no inertia, and the ship goes where the nose points. The
// roll and pitch rates ramp while a key is held, and decay when it is released.
// That gives the classic "keyboard analogue" feel.
//
// It knows nothing about keyboards. `update()` takes a FlightDemand, which is
// what the pilot WANTS. Whoever has the stick produces one:
//
//   - the human, through engine/flight-controls.ts;
//   - the defence policy, through game/combat-computer.ts;
//   - a harness or a replay, by four numbers written down.
//
// That is the whole seam, and it is why no browser reaches this file.
//
// The ENVELOPE it flies — top speed, thrust, the two turn caps and the ramp's
// two rates — is `constants/player-flight.ts`. This file is the rule; that one
// is the arguments, and `rampToward` takes another pilot's arguments just as
// readily (see `constants/brain-flight.ts`).

 * in the game. Same number in both files, different flight. That is the
 * project's one-rule-two-homes defect in disguise, because the two homes
 * agreed.
 *
 * `1 - exp(-rate * dt)` is the exact form. The rate is now a time constant in
 * reciprocal seconds, and it means the same thing at any dt.
