// The world's only source of randomness.
//
// Everything the simulation does with chance goes through here: where pirates
// spawn, what cargo a wreck drops, whether an NPC's shot connects, how long
// until the next trader arrives. `Math.random()` is banned in world code and
// `test/run.ts` enforces it.
//
// WHY: a variable timestep and an unseeded PRNG are the two things that make a
// run unrepeatable, and an unrepeatable run cannot be replayed, regression
// tested, or trained against. The timestep is fixed (see FIXED_DT); this is
// the other half.
//
// It is module state, deliberately. The alternative is threading an rng
// parameter through NpcShip, every spawn helper and every damage path — about
// fifty signatures — for a value that is genuinely global to a session. The
// seam that matters is that there is exactly ONE of these and it is seeded on
// purpose, not that it is passed by hand.
//
// The extracted rule modules (encounters.ts, population.ts, systems.ts) take
// an injectable rng instead, because they are pure and their tests want to
// control it directly. Both are right for what they are.

// There are two shapes of generator here and only ONE algorithm (mulberry32).
//
// The world's own stream is module state, because a snapshot needs to READ that
// state: a save taken mid-flight has to resume the same stream it was on, or
// the reception waiting for you changes the moment you reload — which is the
// difference between a snapshot and a rough approximation. A closure cannot be
// read, so the world's stream cannot be one.
//
// `makeRng` is the other shape: an INDEPENDENT stream, for a harness that wants
// chance of its own without disturbing the world's — the campaign playtest, an
// episode's opponent draw. It used to live in ai-training/core.ts as a second
// copy of the same eight lines, which is exactly the duplication this file's
// header complains about. One algorithm, one home, two shapes.
