// What a save IS. Four things: its name, the id it lives under, the one line a
// player tells two of them apart by, and what taking one COSTS. PURE: no
// localStorage, no DOM and no clock.
//
// `storage.ts` owns WHERE a save lives and is still the only file that may
// touch localStorage. This owns WHAT one is, which is why the name rules, the
// id encoding and the list line can all be asserted under node.
//
// THE MODEL (docs/TODO/40). To save is a deliberate act, and the NAME IS THE
// IDENTITY of a manual save. A save under a name that already exists replaces
// it. So there is no rename, no duplicate and no hidden id.
//
// The player does not name an autosave at all. An autosave lives under a
// reserved `auto:` id shape that a typed name cannot reach. That is what makes
// "an autosave can never overwrite a named save" a property of the key space
// rather than a promise.
