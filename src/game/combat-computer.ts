// The TRAINED-brain seat of the combat computer: a defence policy flying your
// ship. DORMANT today — no trained policy ships (`brains.ts`'s `defenceBrain`
// returns null) and `step` disengages without a brain, so the co-pilot the
// game actually flies is scripted-co-pilot.ts's pure-pursuit dogfighter
// (game.ts's `pilotDemand` chooses between the two). The seat stays because a
// future candidate re-enters through it unchanged.
//
// The module works out what the autopilot WANTS and reports it as a
// `FlightDemand` — the SAME thing a human's hands produce
// (engine/flight-controls.ts), flown by the same `PlayerShip.update`. The
// Game applies it and pulls the trigger, because firing has consequences —
// legal status, bounties, the station's Vipers — that an autopilot has no
// business deciding.
