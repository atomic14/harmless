// The station: arriving at one, leaving one, and the menu in between.
//
// `enterDocked` was a 66-line method of game.ts that did nine unrelated things
// in one breath — reset the shields, hand over survivors, pay a fine, clear the
// sky, roll a market, settle the work you were carrying, write the save, shut
// the bay door and paint a menu. Half of them are consequences of docking and
// half are the docked STATE being set up, and none of them could be read
// without reading all of them.
//
// So it moved, with the two transitions that pair with it (`launch`, and the
// base screen the two of them switch between). The pattern is the project's:
// this decides and reports — `StationEvent`s the Game says out loud — and what
// it cannot own it asks for through `StationHost`.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT EVENTS, and both for the same reason
// (game/rng.ts): `populateSystem` and the Navy mission step DRAW from the
// seeded stream. A draw that moved across a branch would change every seeded
// outcome after it, so they are direct host calls made at exactly the point
// they were made before. The order of the four draws in a dock — the mission's
// target, the market's seed, the offers — is the order the stream saw them in.
//
// A RESUMED DOCK IS THE ONE PLACE TWO OF THOSE DRAWS DO NOT HAPPEN, and it is
// the exception that proves the rule rather than a hole in it. See
// `DockArrival` below: the stream a resume ends on is `snap.rng`, assigned by
// `Persistence.restore` on the line AFTER the one that reaches this method, so
// nothing downstream can observe whether the two rolls were made. Every other
// way onto the pad draws exactly what it drew before.
//
// What this file is NOT: it does not own the rules. The fine is law.ts, the
// market is contracts.ts, the mission is missions.ts, the save is storage.ts.

 *   station rolls today's prices and bulletin board.
 * - `fresh` — a boot with nothing to resume, and the fallback of a respawn for
 *   a career that has never docked. Nothing arrived, so no checkpoint and no
 *   theatre, but `freshState` leaves the market and the board EMPTY and
 *   somebody has to stock them.
 * - `resumed` — a world came off the shelf, or out of the combat simulator's
 *   entry snapshot, and was stocked FROM it a few lines earlier. Rolling here
 *   overwrites what the restore just put back, which is docs/TODO/46: it made
 *   the market and the board rerollable by reloading, and rerollable ON DEMAND
 *   through the simulator, whose seed the player picks and whose promise is
 *   that nothing which happens inside it leaves.
 *
 * The distinction the last two need is not "did we arrive" — neither did — but
 * "is the state we are dressing already dressed", and only the caller knows.
