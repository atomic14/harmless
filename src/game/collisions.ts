// Ships are solid: which two overlap, and how to separate them.
//
// The three collision loops used to sit inside updateFlight, interleaved with
// spawning, energy regeneration and cabin temperature. They are the most purely
// physical thing the game does — geometry in, positions out — so they came out
// first.
//
// The split follows the house rule that NpcShip already uses for the gun. This
// module resolves the OVERLAP and reports what happened. The Game decides what
// it costs.
//
// That line matters, because the cost is neither symmetric nor even consistent:
//
//   - the player's shields absorb a ram;
//   - two NPCs that collide must NOT credit the player with anything (see
//     wreckNpc against destroyNpc);
//   - a ship that bounces off the station takes no damage at all.
