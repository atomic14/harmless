// Which of the commander's two shields a hit lands on.
//
// One line of geometry, and it had two homes. `Combat.hitPlayer` turned the
// attacker's position into the ship's own frame, and read the sign of z. A
// training episode dotted the nose against the direction to the shooter.
//
// They are the same rule written twice. `forward · v > 0` IS `v_local.z < 0`,
// for exactly the reason `forward` is `(0,0,-1)` rotated by the same
// quaternion. "The same rule written twice, agreeing" is what this project is
// organised against, rather than what it settles for.
//
// Neither copy could move without somebody who remembered the other. Which face
// a shot lands on decides which pool it spends, and the commander has two of
// them (docs/TODO/64).
//
// HERS, and only hers. A ship carries one bank and has no facing at all
// (npc.ts `takeDamage`), so there is nothing here for an NPC to ask.
//
// No allocation: the two scratch objects are the caller's, because this is on
// the path every hit in the game takes.
