// witch-space were four separate concerns interleaved across two methods of
// game.ts, sharing one `if (this.witchspace)` between them. Witch-space is the
// awkward case — the target is *retained* for an escape jump that costs a flat
// rate instead of the chart distance — and having it stated once, here, is
// most of the reason this file exists.
//
// The metric itself is galaxy/navigation.ts and the numbers are
// constants/jump.ts; this is the transaction.
