// What each command DOES, in the player's words. The captions to controls.ts.
//
// `controls.ts` owns which KEY asks for a command; this file owns the one line
// that says what the player gets, and `Record<Command, CommandHelp>` welds the
// two together: add a `Command` next door and this file does not compile until
// somebody has written down what it does. That is the whole point. Invariant 9
// used to be four hand-maintained lists, and what it cost was two live keys —
// the distress beacon, which hands GalCop your cargo, and ⇧Y, which dumps five
// tonnes — that appeared in NO help surface the game shipped.
//
// Nothing here is a rule and nothing branches on it. Three surfaces render it
// and none of them holds a copy:
//
//   the `?` panel      ui/key-help.ts paints it into play.html's hosts
//   the manual page    src/manual.ts renders the same tables
//   the station menu   ui/screens.ts builds its rows and keyline from it
//
// so a key that changes in `controls.ts` changes in all three, or the build
// fails. The README is the one surface still written by hand, because it is
// prose for people who have not launched the game — `test/key-help.test.ts`
// holds it to this table in both directions.
