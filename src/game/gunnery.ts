// The player's guns: which mount fires, whether it can, and how forgiving it is.
//
// The other half of the combat model that systems.ts owns — systems.ts holds
// the heat and the cooldown, this decides what pulling the trigger means. The
// *rules* are here and pure; finding what the shot hit stays with the raycast,
// because there is no honest way to test "does this ray pass through that hull"
// without the hulls.
//
// One split is worth naming. A mount's CADENCE and HEAT are Harmless's numbers
// and always were; what one hit is WORTH is the released game's, and a property
// of the hull as much as of the laser — the pack gives each of the 15 flyable
// ships its own byte per laser. So `LASER_PACING` (constants/player-gun.ts)
// holds the first, `playerLaserHit` looks up the second, and neither is a second
// home for the other. What that hit COSTS a target is game/npc-energy.ts's.
//
// BOTH GUNS ARE RESOLVED HERE, asymmetrically, because the released game is.
// Outgoing, this answers the STRENGTH and the target applies its own defence
// (`npc-energy.ts`); incoming, the pack tabulates the finished number for every
// (build, hull) pair, so `npcLaserDamageToPlayer` answers it in one call and
// `systems.ts` spends it. Neither restates a line of the oracle's arithmetic.
//
// The numbers both guns are governed by are constants/player-gun.ts and
// constants/npc-gun.ts, which is where the reasoning for each of them lives too.
