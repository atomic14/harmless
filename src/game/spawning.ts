// Turning a population plan into ships in the sky.
//
// population.ts decides WHAT a system holds; this puts it there. The split is
// worth the two files: the plan is pure and unit-tested against the rules that
// make a galaxy feel inhabited, and this half is nothing but placement — where
// a trader sits relative to the station, how a reception scatters along the
// corridor you are about to fly down.
//
// The combat-training arena is the same job with a different plan: where an
// exercise is safe to fight (arenaCentre) and where authored opposition goes
// (spawnOpposition). Which fight it is stays with the scenario table, exactly
// as which system this is stays with population.ts.
//
// Nothing here decides anything. Give it the same plan twice and you get the
// same sky twice.
//
// The distances are constants/spawn-placement.ts for a system's own traffic and
// constants/opposition-ring.ts for an arena's — two files because they answer
// different questions and have to be free to move apart.
