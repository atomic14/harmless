// The shape of the released-Elite-A reference catalogue.
//
// Hand-written, and the only file here that is. Everything beside it ending
// `.generated.ts` is written by `npm run generate:elite-a`, from the vendored
// pack in `reference/elite-a/source`. So these interfaces are the contract the
// importer emits against. `tools/elite-a/build.mjs` asserts the pack still
// splits into exactly these fields. It stops if it does not.
//
// Three identities, because three future features move independently:
//
//   PlayerHullId       which of the 15 flyable hulls the commander is in
//   ShipDesignId       which of the 38 hulls is on screen — geometry lives here
//   NpcVariantId       which exact S.A-S.W build of that design this one is
//
// The split is the point. A design's geometry, size, speed and cargo never vary
// between its variants, so they are stored ONCE on the design. Energy, defence,
// weapon byte and bounty do vary, so they are what a variant record holds. A
// variant is therefore ten numbers, not thirty-two, and there is exactly one
// copy of each hull.
//
// This file describes DATA. It contains no combat arithmetic and must not grow
// any: the rules that read these numbers belong to the combat module.
