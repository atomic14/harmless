// The Elite-A catalogue, and the only way to look anything up in it.
//
// The generated modules are flat arrays in source order. That is what makes
// their diffs reviewable and their emission deterministic. Nothing outside this
// file should scan them. Ask here by id, and get back one record or a merged
// combat profile.
//
// `recommendedNpcProfile(designId)` is the one that matters today. The pack
// suggests a stat block per design. The importer resolved that to an ACTUAL
// exact variant with the same combat tuple, and stored the id. Where several
// matched, it took the first in A-W order.
//
// So the current roster flies a real released build of the ship, rather than an
// average of several. A later feature may pick a variant by system instead, and
// combat will not notice: it already read a variant.
//
// Everything here is data lookup. There is no combat arithmetic in this file,
// and there must not be. How a hit resolves is the combat module's rule. This
// is where that module gets its numbers.
