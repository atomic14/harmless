// The commander file: the saves you made, the saves the game made, and the
// three screens over them.
//
// `storage.ts` owns where a save lives and `save-file.ts` owns what one is and
// what taking one costs. What lives here is the half above both: the list, the
// deliberate act of naming a save, and renaming a commander — plus the keyboard
// state machine for each, behind the Screen contract (invariant 13). Typing a
// name is `typed-name.ts`, saves that leave the browser are `save-transfer.ts`,
// and STARTING a commander is `new-commander.ts`.
//
// Following the same discipline as NpcShip: these screens decide nothing about
// game state. They return an OUTCOME and the host applies it, so the mode
// machine stays in one place.
//
// AND NOTHING HERE WRITES BECAUSE IT WAS LOOKED AT (docs/TODO/55): the run in
// progress is a LINE ABOVE THE TABLE, read out of state, not a checkpoint filed
// on open — a screen that files a save the moment you press S is one you cannot
// open just to check something.
