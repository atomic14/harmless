// "Data on system": the entry from the 1984 manual, plus whatever the living

//
// Reachable from the docked menu, the galactic chart and the short-range
// chart, and Escape has to go back to whichever one you came from. That used
// to need a `dataReturn: 'docked' | 'chart' | 'local'` field on the Game. It
// was set on the way in and consulted on the way out: a one-deep return stack
// for a single screen.
//
// The real stack deletes the problem. `back` returns to whatever is underneath,
// whatever that happens to be.
