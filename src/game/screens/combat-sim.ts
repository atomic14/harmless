// The combat trainer's front of house: pick a fight, read the report, hold two
// of them against each other.
//
// The modules underneath answer everything:
//
//   - combat-sim-scenarios.ts says who can be sent at you;
//   - combat-sim.ts runs the exercise;
//   - combat-sim-report.ts counts what happened;
//   - combat-sim-compare.ts decides what two records may honestly show;
//   - combat-sim-setup.ts owns the draft.
//
// What is left here is the keyboard, the three panels, and the export.
//
// **The exercise is NOT this screen.** `Game.mode` is derived
// (`screens.topId ?? baseMode`), and `updateFlight()` runs only while it is
// `'flight'`. So the world does not step while an overlay is open.
//
// One screen id holds three PANELS, with the fight in between. You pick a
// fight. You launch. You fly it as ordinary flight, under a different
// `StepHost`. The Game then re-opens this screen on the report panel as it
// tears the fight down. Compare is the report panel's own second view: press
// ENTER from the record you want as the baseline.
//
// It obeys the Screen contract. It never sets the mode. It never touches the
// Game. It returns an outcome. What it needs from the Game is four things
// behind `CombatSimContext`:
//
//   1. the commander the fit-out starts from;
//   2. the records of the last exercise;
//   3. something to say out loud;
//   4. `begin`.
