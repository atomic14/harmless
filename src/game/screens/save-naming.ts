// Typing a name at the station: naming a SAVE, and renaming the COMMANDER.
//
// Two screens, one keyboard (`typed-name.ts`), and one thing worth keeping
// straight — they act on different nouns. A save's name IS its identity on the
// shelf, so typing one that exists replaces it; a commander's name is what the
// pilot is CALLED today, and deliberately does not move a single save.
//
// Split out of `saves.ts` in docs/TODO/55, which is a file about the list of
// saves and what you can do to it. The list took on a load confirmation there;
// naming was never the same subject, and "the list AND naming AND renaming" was
// the sort of header that means a file has stopped being about one thing.
//
// `SavesContext` is still `saves.ts`'s — it is the slice of the Game every
// screen over the shelf sees, and a second copy of it would be a second answer
// to what these screens may touch.

/**
 * Renaming the COMMANDER, which is not the same act as naming a save.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, and it is stated on the screen rather than left to be found
 * out: it changes what you are CALLED — `CommanderData.name`, which is what the
 * status screen, the docked menu and the save prompt show — and it does NOT
 * move your saves. They stay filed under the name you were created with, which
 * is what `save:auto:<CAREER>:*` is keyed by (save-file.ts).
 *
 * That is a decision, not an omission (docs/TODO/56). Moving them would be a
 * write across five keys — the checkpoint, three flight slots and the boot
 * pointer — with a half-done state in the middle of it, and TODO 44's rule is
 * that nothing may be deleted on the strength of a write that failed. A rename
 * that half-succeeded would leave a commander addressable under two names or
 * under neither, so the cheap act stays cheap and the screen says what it did.
 *
 * Pushed on top of the file list rather than sitting beside it as a peer mode,
 * so cancelling is just `back` and the list underneath re-paints itself. It
 * owns its own buffer — nothing else has any business reading a half-typed
 * name.
