// The Navy mission: find the Constrictor, kill it, carry the plans home.
//
// A five-stage state machine that was spread across three private methods of
// game.ts and one branch of destroyNpc, with the only piece that had escaped
// — the raised mis-jump chance during the courier run — already living in
// galaxy/navigation.ts. That stray was the clue that the rest belonged
// somewhere.
//
// Pure: it takes the commander and the galaxy, and returns what happened. The
// Game announces it and pays it, because credits and legal status are its
// business. That also means the headless campaign can score the mission,
// which it could not before.
//
//   stage 0  not started — needs 16 kills, and galaxy 1
//   stage 1  hunting the Constrictor at a known system
//   stage 2  destroyed; report back for the next orders
//   stage 3  carrying the plans to a named system
//   stage 4  done
