// Is something else flying the ship, and what does it want?
//
// Two pieces of equipment answer to that: the docking computer, which flies you
// into the slot (the approach itself is `docking.ts`, stepped by
// `world-step.ts`), and the combat computer, whose shipped pilot is the
// scripted pure-pursuit co-pilot (`scripted-co-pilot.ts` does the thinking;
// `combat-computer.ts` is the trained seat, dormant while no weights load). They had
// nothing to do with each other in game.ts and everything to do with each other
// in fact: both are bought, both are engaged with one key, both hand the ship
// back the moment the pilot touches the controls, and both end up as a
// `FlightDemand` that `PlayerShip.update` flies.
//
// So they share a file, and it follows the project's pattern: this DECIDES and
// reports `AutopilotEvent`s, and the Game says them out loud. The sounds are
// events too — named sounds and the docking music, both `SoundEvent`s (sounds.ts) —
// which is what keeps the file free of `audio.ts` and therefore of the browser.
// Nothing here draws from the seeded rng, so there is no ordering to preserve.
//
// What this file does NOT own: the flying. The docking approach is docking.ts,
// the policy is combat-computer.ts, and pulling the trigger is the Game's,
// because firing has consequences — legal status, bounties, the station's
// Vipers — that an autopilot has no business deciding.
