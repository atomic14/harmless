// The commander's ship as a set of numbers: energy, shields, laser heat,
// cabin temperature — how they regenerate, and what a hit costs.
//
// Simulation, not presentation. No three.js: a hit needs to know only whether
// it came from in front.
//
// THE BANKS ARE 255-POINT POOLS AND WHOLE NUMBERS, because a fractional point
// is not something a 6502 byte can express. Every way of hurting them arrives
// as `PlayerPoolPoints` (damage-units.ts), minted by the module that owns the
// rule: an NPC laser through `gunnery.ts`'s `npcLaserDamageToPlayer` (its
// power, less this hull's armour, once), and a ram, a canister, the Coriolis
// wall or a warhead through `constants/impact.ts`.
//
// RECHARGE IS HARMLESS POLICY, and the rates are `constants/recharge.ts` — the
// pack gives each hull an `energyRechargeRating` and no clock, so what a rating
// is worth in seconds is a browser-game decision. It accumulates in whole
// sub-ticks rather than a float sum so 15, 60 and 144 Hz agree, the same clock
// the NPC banks run on. Dividing one rating by the Cobra's is the only piece of
// this that could not move into the constants directory: see
// ANCHOR_RECHARGE_RATING.
//
// A snapshot's `systems` is a complete `ShipSystems` and is assigned straight
// across — no migration path. `test/damage-paths.test.ts` fails if the old
// rescaling names come back.
