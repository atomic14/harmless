// What turns up, and when.
//
// The rules that keep a system feeling inhabited: traders arriving from deep
// space, pirate waves in lawless space, and Thargon drones peeling off a
// mothership. All three ran inline in updateFlight as timers interleaved with
// collision resolution and shield regeneration.
//
// The split is the one used throughout: this decides WHETHER something should
// appear and what it should be. The Game makes it exist.
//
// Nothing here can reach the scene, so a test can drive the rules. These
// particular rules had no test at all, and they decide how dangerous every
// system in the galaxy feels.
//
// The clocks and the thresholds are constants/encounters.ts. The cap on traders
// is constants/population.ts, because it is a property of what a system holds
// rather than of the clock that adds to it.
