// Writing the world down, and putting it back.
//
// `snapshot.ts` says what a save LOOKS like, `storage.ts` says where it lives,
// and this says how the running world turns into one and back.
//
// The pattern is the project's: a module decides, the orchestrator applies.
// Restoring is the one place that cannot be purely declarative — putting a
// world back means REBUILDING it, and a rebuild spawns ships, opens the
// station menu and rerolls a market. Those reach outside the state, so they
// come in through `PersistenceHost` (below), exactly as the world step asks for
// its consequences through `StepHost`.
//
// TWO ORDERINGS ARE LOAD-BEARING and neither is obvious:
//
//   1. The galaxy is rebuilt BEFORE the ships are placed, because an NPC's
//      position is only meaningful against a station that exists.
//   2. `restoreRng` is LAST. Everything above it — buildWorld, enterWitchspace,
//      enterDocked — draws from the seeded stream, and saving the generator's
//      *state* rather than its seed is what makes the next draw after a reload
//      the draw the run was about to make.
//
// This file is NOT in the `purity` list in test/run.ts and should not be: it
// reaches persistence through its host. Everything it does to the state,
// though, it does without a renderer.
