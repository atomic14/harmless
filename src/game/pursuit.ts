// The pursuit dogfighter's shipless decisions: how fast to fly to sit in
// gun range behind a target, and the break-off that keeps a chase from
// becoming a ram.
//
// Two pilots fly these, so they live in ONE place rather than two: the combat
// computer flying the commander's ship (scripted-co-pilot.ts) and a pursuit
// pirate (npc.ts). What is NOT here is the STEERING: the co-pilot points the
// commander's yaw-less ship with `pitch-roll-steer.ts` and an NPC arc-slews
// its quaternion, two different flight models pointed at the same aim. This
// file decides the aim and the speed; each caller flies them its own way.
