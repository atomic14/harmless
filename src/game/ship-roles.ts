// What a ship is FOR, and which released designs are ALLOWED to be it.
//
// `ship-specs.ts` says which hulls Harmless actually flies in each role. This
// says which hulls it may choose from, and the roster does not get a vote:
// Elite-A files every ship into one of 31 numbered blueprint slots, the same
// slot means the same job in all 23 released sets, and a design that never
// occupies a band is not a ship of that kind however much it looks like one.
//
//     6-8    mining        boulder, asteroid, splinter
//     9-10   shuttle, transporter
//     11-14  trader        (14 is the large carrier)
//     15     small child ship — what a mother ship launches
//     16     cop
//     17-24  pirate
//     25-28  bounty hunter
//     29-30  Thargoid, Thargon
//     31     the Constrictor, and nothing else
//
// Membership is read from what the sets DID, not from what the pack says a
// design may do (`eliteADesignsInSlotRange` in elite-a/catalogue.ts explains
// the difference). The Sidewinder is allowed in slots 19-24 and no released set
// ever put one there, so counting permissions would quietly widen every role.
//
// Harmless's roles are COARSER than the source's bands, so the mapping below is
// a decision and is written down as one. The one that matters: a Harmless
// `trader` covers the shuttle, transporter, trader and child bands, because
// Harmless has no separate role for a station shuttle or for the small craft a
// carrier launches, and both are civilian traffic here.
//
// That last band has a consequence worth stating. Slot 15 holds the Worm and
// the Sidewinder, so admitting it makes a Sidewinder a PERMITTED trader — and
// the alternative was to drop the band and with it the Worm, which has flown as
// civilian traffic here since long before the catalogue arrived and occupies no
// other civilian slot. Permission is not selection: the roster puts no
// Sidewinder in the trader list and `test/ship-roles.test.ts` says so. This
// module's job is to stop a hull being filed somewhere the source never filed
// it, not to make every choice for the roster.
//
// Two roles are OURS and have no band at all — the rock hermit and the
// generation ship. That emptiness is the point: a custom ship must not be able
// to wander into a released parity matrix, and `test/ship-roles.test.ts` holds
// it to that.
