// The three-phase attack run — close, pass, extend — as a shipless decision:
// where to point the nose, and how fast to fly.
//
// The rules it builds on are each one-home and pure: the phase machine and
// throttle curve (break-off.ts), the lead and pass-width arithmetic
// (pass-aim.ts), the run-out curve (extend-arc.ts), the tactic profiles
// (constants/tactics.ts). This file is the vector composition that turns those
// numbers into an aim point — behaviour too, so it lives in ONE place: npc.ts
// (every pirate) and the commander's scripted co-pilot both call it, and a
// second copy would drift from the run the co-pilot is meant to replicate.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: wingman separation (a gang concern, composed
// on top by npc.ts), the trigger (the NPC gun and the commander's laser are
// different instruments), and the tactic SWITCH (it reads a ship's own hull
// and hurt — the caller chooses the tactic, this flies it).
//
// The steer decision and the speed decision are two calls because they happen
// either side of the steering itself: the closing throttle reads the heading
// error AFTER the nose has moved this frame's step, and folding the two into
// one call was measurably not the same fight.
