// What the player's shot hit.
//
// Two passes, in this order:
//
//   1. the honest test — does the beam actually pass through a hull?
//   2. a grazing cone, consulted ONLY if the ray missed everything, so a
//      near-miss that clips a silhouette still counts (see gunnery.ts)
//
// Both passes skip what cannot be shot: a dead ship, and a drifting object still
// inside its launch grace (GitHub #28). This is the one home of that skip, so a
// graced capsule cannot be struck squarely OR grazed.
//
// I nearly left this in game.ts on the grounds that "there is no honest way to
// test a raycast without the hulls". That was wrong, and worth recording: this
// project already proved three.js maths runs under node with no canvas and no
// WebGL, so the hulls can simply be BUILT in a test. Which they are.
