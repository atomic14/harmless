// The scripted combat computer: a PURSUIT DOGFIGHTER flying YOUR ship.
//
// What a person does is get on the opponent's six and shoot it up, hauling the
// throttle back to swing the nose round and stay on a crossing target. That is
// pure pursuit — point the nose AT the target (the laser is hitscan, so no
// lead: aim where it is), which curves you onto its tail as it turns and runs —
// plus a throttle that holds a gun-range standoff behind it and comes off hard
// when the nose has a long way to swing. It flies `pursuit.ts`, not the attack
// run; the pirates fly their own pursuit — hold the six, break into a slashing
// pass when faced (npc.ts `pursue`) — a separate ship and decision, sharing
// `pursuitSpeed` so the two cannot drift.
//
// It DECIDES and reports, like every module here: what comes back is a
// `FlightDemand` — ramped pitch and roll rates, a throttle, a trigger — and one
// E.C.M. request. The Game flies the demand through the same `PlayerShip.update`
// a human's keys do (which is what puts the co-pilot's turning on the HUD
// needles) and pulls the trigger with its legal consequences.
//
// How it POINTS the nose is `pitch-roll-steer.ts`: the player's ship has no yaw
// axis, so it banks the target onto the pitch plane and pulls up to it, at the
// commander's OWN caps and ramp (PLAYER_FLIGHT).
