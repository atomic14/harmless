// Explosions and tracer bolts: the things that are only ever seen.
//
// They have no effect on anything. Nothing reads them, and nothing collides
// with them. They are deliberately absent from the snapshot. A world reloaded
// without the last half-second of sparks costs nothing.
//
// They were four fragments of game.ts. Two were add methods, a thousand lines
// apart. Two were filter loops in the flight step, wedged between the missiles
// and the laser. It is small. It is also exactly the kind of thing a reader should find
// by its name, rather than by memory of where somebody wrote it.
//
// The classes themselves lived in npc.ts until now, and that made the point
// twice over. This file was NAMED for them, and it had to import them from a
// ship behaviour module 1200 lines long. They have nothing to do with an NPC:
// the player explodes too, and so does a canister.
