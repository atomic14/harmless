// Which threat a defence brain fights: the nearest — but committed to.
//
// Three places pick the threat a defence brain is flown against. They are the
// combat computer (your co-pilot), an armed trader under attack, and the
// training episode's target. All three used to take the nearest hostile from
// scratch every frame, with no memory. So with two attackers near-equidistant,
// the "target" flipped identity up to 26.8 times a minute. The bearing the
// brain observes jumped about 90 degrees each time. No pilot flies like that.
// You fight the ship in front of you until another is clearly the bigger
// problem. You do not change your mind twice in the same breath.
//
// The rule needs BOTH tests. A distance margin alone barely helps. The scripted
// attack run extends the fought ship out to thousands of units, while the next
// one dives to hundreds. So an overtake is decisive, and even a 5x margin left
// 9 switches a minute. The sweep is beside the constants. The hold time is what
// turns a pick into a commitment.
//
// ONE rule, one home, used by all three. The fix lives outside the brain on
// purpose, so it serves whichever policy flies. That includes the current
// brains.

/**
 * The threat to fight, held across frames.
 *
 * `pick` is called with the time since it was last asked, the live threats,
 * and a distance measure. The held threat is kept until one of two things
 * happens:
 *
 * - it dies or leaves the list, and the nearest replaces it at once;
 * - it held for at least `THREAT_MIN_HOLD` seconds, AND a rival is nearer than
 *   its distance divided by `THREAT_SWITCH_MARGIN`. That is an overtake rather
 *   than a tie-break.
 *
 * `committed` is an optional veto. When it returns true for the held threat, no
 * rival can take the lock, however near. The caller is EFFECTIVELY ENGAGED: it
 * is on the threat, and it makes progress. A pilot does not abandon a ship it
 * is about to kill because another drifted closer (Chris, flying it).
 *
 * The distance rule above still governs everything else. The veto fires only
 * while the caller says it is engaged. A threat that dies or leaves is still
 * replaced at once. A caller that passes nothing keeps the pure distance rule.
 *
 * The lock is NOT saved state. After a restore, the first `pick` locks the
 * nearest hostile and commits to it. That is a defensible first move from cold,
 * made once per reload. What the snapshot must never lose is the flight the
 * decision produces, and that flight IS saved: the ramped rates, and the
 * cached control.
