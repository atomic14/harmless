// The command layer: the discrete things the player asks for, as data.
//
// Flight already had this seam. `FlightDemand` (src/player.ts) is what a pair
// of hands WANTS — rates, throttle, trigger — and a keyboard, the combat
// computer or a test harness can each produce one, all flown by the same
// `PlayerShip.update`. Everything else the player can do was still a
// hand-written `else if` chain of `input.pressed(...)` inside game.ts, and that
// cost three things: the bindings were not readable as a list, nothing but a
// browser could ask for one, and the only way to check that M opens the market
// was to play it.
//
// So this is the same move for the discrete half. This file DECIDES what was
// asked for and reports `Command`s; game.ts's `runCommand` applies them. The
// tables below are the half of CLAUDE.md's KEY-BINDINGS INVARIANT that used to
// be code, and they are now the only home of a command key: what each one DOES
// is `command-help.ts` next door, welded to this file by `Record<Command, …>`,
// and the `?` panel, the manual page and the station menu are all RENDERED from
// the pair (`ui/key-help.ts`). `engine/keymap.ts` owns the flight axes; the
// README is prose, and `test/key-help.test.ts` holds it to this table.
//
// It reads an INPUT, not a browser: `CommandInput` is the two methods a
// binding needs, `engine/input.ts` satisfies it structurally, and a replay or
// an AI satisfies it with an object literal. That is why this file is in the
// purity block despite being "the keyboard".
//
// Three rules the old chains encoded, all load-bearing:
//
//  - **One command per frame from a chain.** `Input.pressed()` consumes a tap,
//    so an `else if` chain could only ever run one branch. The scan stops at
//    the first match for that reason — it is not an optimisation. A tap the
//    chain did not reach is not dropped at the end of the frame any more
//    (`engine/input.ts` carries it, briefly and boundedly), so it is offered
//    to the NEXT frame's table — which is how a mashed key reaches the game
//    twice instead of once, and why the tables below must stay per mode.
//  - **The view keys are independent.** The digit loop ran BEFORE the chain and
//    did not stop it, so 2 and G in the same frame still switches to the rear
//    view *and* opens the chart.
//  - **Shift is tested before the tap is consumed.** ⇧H is the galactic jump
//    and H the ordinary one; reading `pressed('KeyH')` first would eat the tap
//    on the shifted entry and then find nothing left for the plain one.

/**
 * Everything the player can ask for that is not flying the ship.
 *
 * Deliberately intents, not actions: `openMarket`, never `screens.open`. What
 * a command COSTS — a beep, a screen, a save, a jump — is the Game's business,
 * which is what lets this file be a table.

 *  - `toggleDockingComputer` — it flies you at a station 77,000 units away and
