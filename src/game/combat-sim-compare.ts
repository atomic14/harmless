// Two records, held against each other — and the refusal when they may not be.
//
// The trainer is an A/B rig (docs/COMBAT-SIM.md): same seed, same scenario, two
// brains, two reports — which is why the seed is on the record.
//
// It derives, and it accumulates nothing: everything here is a function of two
// finished `CombatSimReport`s. Records exported yesterday compare exactly as two
// flown a minute ago.
//
// The load-bearing part is the REFUSAL. Two fights are not an A/B where any of
// six things differ: the seed, the scenario, the mode, the wave, the hull or
// the fit-out. A difference column over them looks like a result, and is not
// one.
//
// So a confound is NAMED, with both values, and the difference column stays
// unpainted. Different BRAINS is the point. Different anything else is a
// confound.
//
// There is deliberately NO verdict, no score and no "which brain won". The
// report presents, and the pilot judges. Even the difference carries no sign of
// good or bad. More damage taken is worse for a pilot, and it is exactly what a
// playtester hunts for. A renderer that coloured it would decide which of the
// two you are.
