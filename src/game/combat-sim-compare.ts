// finished `CombatSimReport`s. Records exported yesterday compare exactly as two
// flown a minute ago.
//
// The load-bearing part is the REFUSAL. Two fights on different seeds, scenarios,
// modes, waves, hulls or fit-outs are not an A/B, and a difference column over
// them looks like a finding and is not one. So a confound is NAMED, with both
// values, and the difference column is not painted. Different BRAINS is the
// point; different anything else is a confound.
//
// There is deliberately NO verdict, no score and no "which brain won": the
// report presents, the pilot judges. Even the difference is left unsigned in
// meaning — more damage taken is worse for a pilot and exactly what a playtester
// hunts for, and a renderer that coloured it would be deciding which you are.
