// The world: the scene, and everything in it.
//
// One place that owns the ships, the cargo, the effects and the system's
// scenery — so a module that needs "what is out there" takes a World instead
// of inventing its own view of the Game. Every extraction before this one had
// to define its own context interface (OrdnanceContext, TradeContext,
// ChartContext…) because there was nothing else to hand it. Those are all
// gone now: a module that needs the sky takes a World, and a module that
// needs nothing takes plain data.
//
// It owns objects and their lifetimes. It does NOT own rules: what a system
// should contain lives in population.ts, what turns up later in encounters.ts,
// and what any of it COSTS stays with the Game, which is the only thing that
// may pay a bounty or move your legal status.
