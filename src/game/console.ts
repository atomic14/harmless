// The console seam: the ONE file that puts anything on `globalThis`.
//
// Same bargain as storage.ts, which is the only file that knows a save lives in
// localStorage. Swap this for a no-op and the engine is unchanged; a desktop
// port simply does not call it.
//
// The distinction it draws is the useful one. There are two kinds of global and
// only one of them is a design fault:
//
//   a FLAG is READ by game code to change what the game does. There were five:
//   `__scriptedPirates`, `__legacyPirates`, `__packBrain`, `__sharpPirates` and
//   `__cheat`. They are all gone.
//
//   A rule read from ambient state is a rule with no home. It is not in the
//   snapshot, so a reload changed the game. It is not an argument either, so a
//   test could only set it and hope to clear up. They are fields of GameState
//   now (see BrainSelection, GameState.cheat).
//
//   a HANDLE is WRITTEN by the game so a human or an agent can reach in from a
//   console. Nothing reads it, nothing branches on it, and removing it removes
//   the entire verification workflow in CLAUDE.md rather than a behaviour. So
//   handles stay — but they live here, published through one function, so that
//   "does the engine touch globals?" has a one-word answer.
//
// `npm test` enforces the split: no file outside this one may assign to
// globalThis, and no game rule may read from it. That is what stops the flags
// growing back one convenience at a time.
