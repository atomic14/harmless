// Which hull, which design, which exact build — and the one way to say so.
//
// Three identities, because three things move independently (the fidelity
// contract in docs/TODO/completed/ELITE-A-COMBAT-PLAN.md says the same):
//
//   PlayerHullId         which of the 15 flyable hulls the commander is in
//   ShipDesignId         which hull is on screen — geometry hangs off this
//   NpcCombatProfileId   which exact S.A-S.W build of that design this one is
//
// They are STRINGS, and namespaced, for two reasons. A save reading
// `"elite-a:variant:B:10"` says what it means years later, where a bare `10`
// does not; and the two Harmless inventions carry `harmless:` ids that can
// never be mistaken for a recovered Elite-A design. That separation is a
// requirement: the generation ship is ours and must not be presented as source
// data.
//
// WHAT GOES IN A SAVE IS AN ID. Never an expanded record, geometry object, or
// copied stat block. An id resolves to exactly one immutable record here; a
// record copied into a save is a second home for a rule the catalogue owns, and
// goes stale the day the pack is re-imported.
//
// And identity is never INFERRED. Comparing `spec.def === COBRA_MK3` or reading
// a mesh's name to work out what a ship is makes the geometry table the
// identity table, so a shared or replaced hull silently changes what a ship IS.
// The roster states its ids (ship-specs.ts) and everything else asks here.
//
// This file is data lookup and validation. No combat arithmetic (that is
// `elite-a/combat-math.ts`) and no selection policy: which variant a system
// offers is a future blueprint loader's business, and the only choice made here
// is the deterministic recommended one the current roster flies.
