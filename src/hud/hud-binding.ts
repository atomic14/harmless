// Reading the world onto the dashboard.
//
// The single largest method left in game.ts (100 lines) was the one that
// turned "what is happening" into "what the HUD draws" — the compass rule, the
// condition light, the docking aid, the threat arrow, the target boxes, and
// twenty-odd gauge values. None of it decides anything.
//
// That makes it the clearest statement of the north star in the codebase:
// **the renderer only reads state**. It takes data and returns a picture; hand
// it a snapshot and you get the same dashboard back. There is no `Game` here
// and no callback out — the maths of *where a marker goes* lives in
// hud-model.ts, the painting lives in hud.ts, and this is the wiring between.
