// The screen router: which overlay is open, and who gets the keyboard.
//
// A screen owns its rendering, its keys and its own state, in one file, behind
// two required methods. It never sets the mode, never touches the Game, and
// never reaches for another screen: it returns an OUTCOME and the host acts on
// it — the same discipline NpcShip follows with FireEvent.
//
// FLIGHT IS NOT A SCREEN. The host handles overlays only; `Game` keeps flight
// and the docked/dead base states. The mode you are in is the top of this
// stack, or the base state when it is empty.

// NO PARAMETER PROPERTIES in this file or in any screen: `npm test` runs under
// node's --experimental-strip-types, which rejects `constructor(private x)`
// (Vite compiles it happily, so the failure only shows in the test run).
// Assign fields explicitly instead.
