// This file exists to DELETE homes rather than to add one. Before it, a binding
// was written out by hand in six places: keymap.ts and controls.ts (which are
// the bindings), then play.html's `?` panel, the README, `manual.ts`'s own
// COMMANDS array and the docked menu in `ui/screens.ts` — four copies kept in
// step by hope, and they were not in step. Three of those four render from here
// now, so the only way to change what a key does without changing what the game
// TELLS you it does is to edit the README, which `test/key-help.test.ts` holds
// to the table in both directions.
//
// It renders and nothing else: strings in, strings out, one guarded paint at
// the end. No rule is read from it and nothing branches on what it returns.
