// How far apart two systems are, and what it costs to jump between them.
//
// Extracted because this rule had grown THREE implementations, all of them
// correct and none of them the owner:
//
//   ui/screens.ts   distanceTenths       — what the charts and the game used
//   game/contract-offers.ts chartDistanceTenths — what the campaign used
//   game/game.ts    galacticJump()        — hand-inlined, squared, to pick the
//                                           nearest system in the new galaxy
//
// Byte-identical today, kept so by nothing. That is the same failure mode as
// invariant 5, and it matters more here than it looks: `test/campaign.ts`
// validates the whole economy against its own copy, so a drift would leave the
// balance harness silently measuring a different game from the one shipped.
//
// It lives under galaxy/ because it is a property of the star map, not of the
// UI that draws it or the ship that flies it. Everything above may import it;
// it imports nothing but the system type and the two numbers the metric is.
//
// A FOURTH COPY had grown in galaxy/living.ts by the time the constants move
// reached this file — a private `chartDistance()`, byte-identical down to the
// doc sentence, and a hand-inlined `daysForJump` beside it. Both are this
// file's now.
