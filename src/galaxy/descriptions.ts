// Extended system descriptions — an OPTIONAL overlay on the 1984 galaxy.
//
// `galaxy.ts` and `goatsoup.ts` are byte-matched to the original and are the
// source of truth (invariant 4). Nothing here edits them. This module adds a
// second paragraph beside the goat-soup line, generated offline by a model and
// committed as JSON — see docs/TODO/58 and tools/system-prompts.ts.
//
// The whole design rests on one property: **an absent entry is normal.** Three
// cases render exactly what the game rendered before this existed:
//
//   - no entry for a system;
//   - no file for a galaxy;
//   - an empty overlay.
//
// That property does three things. It lets galaxy 1 ship first. It makes a
// refused record harmless. It keeps generated prose out of any load-bearing
// role over data that nothing generated.
